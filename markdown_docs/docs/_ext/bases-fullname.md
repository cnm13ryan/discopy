## FunctionDef process_bases(app, name, obj, options, bases)
**process_bases**: The function of process_bases is to handle ambiguous inheritance during autodocumentation.

**parameters**: This Function takes several parameters.
· app: The Sphinx application object that provides access to various utilities and configuration settings.
· name: The fully qualified name of the current object being processed.
· obj: The object being documented.
· options: A dictionary containing all the options associated with the autodocumentation process.
· bases: A tuple of base classes for the current object.

**Code Description**: 
The `process_bases` function is part of a Sphinx extension designed to handle inheritance documentation in cases where there might be ambiguities. The function checks if the object has an attribute `__ambiguous_inheritance__`, which indicates potential issues with inheritance. If this attribute exists and is set to `True`, it means that the bases need special handling.

The function then iterates over each base class specified for the current object:
1. It checks whether any of these base classes are present in the ambiguity flag.
2. If a base class is found within the ambiguity, it replaces this base with a reference formatted as `:class:`Module.Name`, ensuring that the documentation reflects the correct module and class names.

This function is called by the `setup` method during the autodocumentation process. Specifically, it connects to the event `autodoc-process-bases`, which is triggered whenever bases need to be processed for a documented object. The `setup` method ensures that `process_bases` is registered as a handler for this event.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that all base classes are correctly specified and that any ambiguity flags are properly set in the objects being documented. This helps maintain accurate and clear inheritance documentation within Sphinx-generated documentation.
## FunctionDef setup(app)
**setup**: The function of setup is to configure the Sphinx application by connecting an event handler.

**parameters**:
· app: The Sphinx application object that provides access to various utilities and configuration settings.
· name: The fully qualified name of the current object being processed.
· obj: The object being documented.
· options: A dictionary containing all the options associated with the autodocumentation process.
· bases: A tuple of base classes for the current object.

**Code Description**: 
The `setup` function is part of a Sphinx extension designed to enhance the autodocumentation process, particularly focusing on handling inheritance documentation. Specifically, it connects an event handler to the `autodoc-process-bases` event, which triggers when bases need to be processed for a documented object.

When this event is triggered, the `process_bases` function (defined in another part of the code) is called. The `setup` method ensures that `process_bases` is registered as a handler for the `autodoc-process-bases` event, thereby providing a mechanism to process and potentially resolve ambiguities in inheritance during autodocumentation.

The return value of the `setup` function includes metadata about the extension:
- `'version': '0.1'`: The version number of the extension.
- `'parallel_read_safe': True`: Indicates that the extension is safe for parallel reading, meaning it can be used in a multi-processing environment without issues related to file locking or other synchronization problems.
- `'parallel_write_safe': True`: Similarly, this indicates that the extension is safe for parallel writing, ensuring compatibility with environments where multiple processes might write to the same files.

**Note**: Ensure that all base classes are correctly specified and any ambiguity flags (`__ambiguous_inheritance__`) are properly set in the objects being documented. This helps maintain accurate and clear inheritance documentation within Sphinx-generated documentation.

**Output Example**: The `setup` function returns a dictionary with the following structure:
```python
{
    'version': '0.1',
    'parallel_read_safe': True,
    'parallel_write_safe': True,
}
```
