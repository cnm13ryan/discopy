## FunctionDef is_close_smallno(a, b)
**is_close_smallno**: The function of is_close_smallno is to check if two numbers are close within very small tolerances.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: a - The first number to compare.
· parameter2: b - The second number to compare.

**Code Description**: This function uses the `is_close` method with relative tolerance (rtol) and absolute tolerance (atol) set to 1e-15. It is designed to check if two floating-point numbers are close to each other within a very small margin of error, which is essential in numerical computations where precision is critical.

This function is frequently called by various test functions in the project to verify that different evaluations or results from the `eval` method are consistent and accurate. For example:
- In `test_mixed_eval`, it checks if evaluating a circuit with and without contractors yields nearly identical results.
- In `test_consistent_eval`, it ensures that pure and mixed state evaluations yield equivalent results when doubled.
- Similarly, in tests like `test_pytorch_pure_eval` and `test_pytorch_consistent_eval`, it confirms the consistency of evaluations across different backends.

**Note**: Ensure that both inputs are floating-point numbers. The function is particularly useful for comparing numerical outputs from complex calculations or simulations where small discrepancies can arise due to rounding errors.

**Output Example**: If `a = 0.123456789` and `b = 0.123456788`, the function will return `True`. However, if `a = 1.0000001` and `b = 1.0000002`, it will return `False` because the difference is beyond the given tolerance.
## FunctionDef test_mixed_eval(c)
**test_mixed_eval**: The function of test_mixed_eval is to verify that evaluating a circuit with and without contractors yields nearly identical results.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: c - An instance or object containing methods such as `eval` and `contractor`.

**Code Description**: The function `test_mixed_eval` checks the consistency of evaluations for a given quantum circuit (represented by the `c` parameter) with and without using contractors. It does this by comparing the results obtained from two different evaluations: one that uses the `contractor` method, and another that performs an evaluation directly.

1. **Evaluation Without Contractors**: The function first calls `c.eval()`, which likely evaluates the quantum circuit without any contractor optimizations.
2. **Evaluation With Contractors**: It then calls `c.eval(contractor=contractor)`, where the `contractor` parameter is used to apply some form of optimization or simplification to the circuit before evaluation.
3. **Comparison Using `is_close_smallno`**: The function uses the `is_close_smallno` method, which checks if two numbers are close within very small tolerances (relative tolerance rtol=1e-15 and absolute tolerance atol=1e-15). This ensures that any minor differences due to numerical precision issues are accounted for.
4. **Assertion**: If the results from the two evaluations are not sufficiently close, an assertion failure will occur, indicating a potential issue with the contractor implementation or evaluation process.

This test function is part of a suite designed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of quantum circuit evaluations in different scenarios, particularly when contractors are used for optimization purposes. It helps identify any discrepancies that might arise due to the use of contractors, ensuring that such optimizations do not introduce significant errors into the final results.

**Note**: Ensure that the `c` parameter is an instance with both `eval` and `contractor` methods defined. The function relies on these methods providing valid numerical outputs for comparison.
## FunctionDef test_consistent_eval(c)
**test_consistent_eval**: The function of test_consistent_eval is to verify that pure state evaluations are consistent with mixed state evaluations when doubled.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: c - The quantum circuit or system being evaluated.

**Code Description**: This function tests the consistency between pure and mixed state evaluations by performing specific operations on a given quantum circuit `c`. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Pure State Evaluation**: First, it evaluates the circuit in its pure state using `c.eval(mixed=False, contractor=contractor)`, which returns `pure_result`.
2. **Mixed State Evaluation**: Then, it performs an evaluation of the same circuit but in a mixed state with `c.eval(mixed=True, contractor=contractor)`, yielding `mixed_result`.
3. **Doubling Pure Result**: The pure result is then doubled using matrix multiplication: `(pure_result @ pure_result.conjugate(diagrammatic=False))`. This step ensures that any discrepancies due to the nature of quantum states are accounted for.
4. **Consistency Check**: Finally, it uses `is_close_smallno(doubled_result, mixed_result.to_tensor())` to check if the doubled pure result is close to the mixed state evaluation result. The function `is_close_smallno` compares two numbers with a very small tolerance (1e-15) to ensure numerical consistency.

This test function is crucial for ensuring that evaluations of quantum circuits yield consistent results across different states, which is essential for validating the correctness and reliability of quantum computations in various scenarios.

## FunctionDef test_pytorch_mixed_eval(c)
**test_pytorch_mixed_eval**: The function of test_pytorch_mixed_eval is to ensure that evaluations using PyTorch backend yield consistent results.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: c - An instance or object whose evaluation needs to be tested for consistency across different contractor settings.

**Code Description**: This function tests the consistency of evaluations between two scenarios within the `pytorch` backend context. Specifically, it evaluates the given object `c` twice using the `eval` method with and without a contractor (contractor=contractor) and then compares these results using the `is_close_smallno` function to ensure they are nearly identical.

The `with tn.DefaultBackend('pytorch'):` statement sets the default backend for tensor network operations to PyTorch, ensuring that all subsequent evaluations within this block use the PyTorch backend. The `is_close_smallno(c.eval(contractor=contractor), c.eval())` line checks if the two evaluations are close using a very small tolerance (1e-15 for both relative and absolute tolerances). This is crucial to validate that the contractor's impact on the evaluation results is minimal, which is important in scenarios where contractors can significantly alter the computational process.

This function is part of a suite of tests designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of evaluations across different backend settings and configurations. It builds upon similar testing functions like `test_mixed_eval`, `test_consistent_eval`, `test_pytorch_pure_eval`, and `test_pytorch_consistent_eval` by providing an additional layer of verification specific to the PyTorch backend.

**Note**: Ensure that `c.eval()` returns a numerical value suitable for comparison. The function is particularly useful in scenarios where contractors are used to optimize evaluations, and it's essential to verify that such optimizations do not introduce significant discrepancies.
## FunctionDef test_pytorch_pure_eval(c)

**Code Description**: In this function, we use the default backend of 'pytorch' to evaluate the given object `c`. The primary purpose is to compare two evaluations of `c`: one without specifying a contractor and another with a specified contractor. We expect these evaluations to be nearly identical due to the consistency in how PyTorch handles computations.

1. **Context within the Project**: This function is part of a suite of tests designed to ensure that different evaluation methods produce consistent results across various backends and configurations. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and accuracy of numerical computations involving quantum circuits or states.
   
2. **Implementation Details**:
    - The `with tn.DefaultBackend('pytorch')` statement ensures that all subsequent operations within this block use PyTorch as the backend for computation.
    - The expression `c.eval(contractor=contractor)` evaluates the object `c` with a specified contractor, which may influence how the evaluation is performed. This could include optimization techniques or specific computational strategies.
    - Similarly, `c.eval()` performs an evaluation without any additional contractors, serving as a baseline for comparison.
    - The `is_close_smallno(c.eval(contractor=contractor), c.eval())` assertion checks if these two evaluations are close to each other within very small tolerances. This is done using the `is_close_smallno` function, which compares floating-point numbers with a relative tolerance (rtol) and absolute tolerance (atol) set to 1e-15.

3. **Functional Relationship**: This function is closely related to other test functions in the project that also use consistency checks between different evaluations. For instance, `test_mixed_eval` might compare results from mixed states with pure states, while `test_consistent_eval` could verify that doubling a state yields consistent results across various backends.

**Note**: Ensure that the object `c` is properly instantiated and its `eval` method is correctly implemented to handle both cases (with and without contractors). The function assumes that these evaluations are meaningful in the context of the quantum circuit or state being tested.
## FunctionDef test_pytorch_consistent_eval(c)
**test_pytorch_consistent_eval**: The function of test_pytorch_consistent_eval is to verify that the evaluation results from the `eval` method are consistent between pure and mixed states using PyTorch as the backend.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: c - The quantum circuit or state object being evaluated.
· parameter2: contractor (optional) - A contractor function used for optimization during evaluation. If not provided, a default contractor is used.

**Code Description**: This function ensures that the results obtained from evaluating a quantum circuit in both pure and mixed states are consistent when using PyTorch as the backend. The steps involved include:

1. **Setting Backend**: The `with tn.DefaultBackend('pytorch')` context manager sets PyTorch as the default execution backend for tensor network operations.
2. **Pure State Evaluation**: The `c.eval(mixed=False, contractor=contractor)` method evaluates the circuit in a pure state without contractors.
3. **Mixed State Evaluation**: The `c.eval(mixed=True, contractor=contractor)` method evaluates the circuit in a mixed state with contractors.
4. **Doubled Result Calculation**: The result from the pure state evaluation is doubled using matrix multiplication (`@`), and its conjugate is taken (diagrammatic=False) to ensure consistency checks are meaningful across different states.
5. **Consistency Check**: The `is_close_smallno(doubled_result, mixed_result.to_tensor())` function uses a small tolerance threshold (1e-15 for both relative and absolute tolerances) to check if the doubled pure state result is close to the mixed state result.

This test function is crucial for ensuring that different representations of quantum states yield equivalent results when evaluated using PyTorch, which is essential for maintaining numerical stability and accuracy in quantum computations. The `is_close_smallno` function plays a key role by providing a robust way to compare floating-point numbers within very small margins of error.

**Note**: Ensure the inputs are valid tensor network objects and that the contractor used (if any) is appropriate for the circuit being evaluated. This test helps verify consistency between pure and mixed state evaluations, which is vital in quantum computing applications where precision is critical.
## FunctionDef test_quimb_pure_eval(c)
**test_quimb_pure_eval**: The function of test_quimb_pure_eval is to compare the result of evaluating a quantum circuit using quimb's contraction method with its direct evaluation.

**parameters**:
· c: A quantum circuit object that supports both `to_quimb()` and `eval()` methods. `c` must be able to convert itself into a format compatible with quimb's operations and also provide an evaluated array representation of the circuit.

**Code Description**: 
The function `test_quimb_pure_eval(c)` takes a single parameter, `c`, which is expected to be a quantum circuit object capable of conversion to a form that can be contracted using the quimb library. The process involves several steps:

1. **Conversion and Contraction with Quimb**:
   - First, the function converts the input quantum circuit `c` into a format suitable for contraction operations via `c.to_quimb()`. This likely involves some internal representation transformation necessary to work with quimb's backend.
   - The converted object is then contracted using `.contract()` method. Contracting typically means performing tensor contractions on the represented tensors or matrices, which effectively reduces their dimensions by summing over matching indices.

2. **Transpose and Index Sorting**:
   - After contraction, the resulting tensor `t` has its data transposed according to the sorted indices of those in `inds`. This step ensures that the tensor is organized in a specific order before comparison.
   - The transpose operation is performed using `np.argsort(t.inds)` which returns the indices that would sort the indices of `t`, and then `.transpose(*...)` applies these sorting indices.

3. **Assertion for Equality**:
   - Finally, an assertion check is performed to ensure that the transposed tensor `t` obtained from quimb's contraction method matches the result of directly evaluating the circuit `c` using `c.eval().array`. If they do not match, a detailed error message indicating the mismatch between `t` and `c.eval().array` is raised.

This function serves as a validation check to ensure that both methods (quimb contraction and direct evaluation) yield consistent results for the same quantum circuit. It helps in debugging or verifying implementations of quantum circuits where multiple evaluation strategies are employed.
