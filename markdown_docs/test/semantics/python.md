**Error Handling**

The service throws specific error types for different failure scenarios, such as invalid credentials, expired session tokens, and failed database operations. These errors are documented in the respective method descriptions.

**Security Considerations**

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using secure algorithms before storage to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure Communication**: All communication between the client and server is done over HTTPS to ensure data privacy.
- **Session Tokens**: Session tokens are generated with sufficient entropy and are stored securely on both client and server sides.

**Usage Example**

```typescript
import { UserAuthenticationService } from 'auth-service';

const authService = new UserAuthenticationService();

async function authenticateUserExample() {
  try {
    const user = await authService.authenticateUser('user@example.com', 'password123');
    console.log(user);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}

authenticateUserExample();
```

**Dependencies**
- `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken` for session management and token generation

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `UserAuthenticationService` functionalities, ensuring that developers can effectively integrate and utilize the service within their applications.
