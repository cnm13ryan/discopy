## FunctionDef test_Word
**test_Word**: The function of `test_Word` is to validate the constructor of the `Word` class by raising type errors when incorrect arguments are provided.
**Parameters**:
Â· name: No explicit parameters are defined for this function.

**Code Description**: 
The function `test_Word` is designed to test the constructor behavior of the `Word` class. It uses a context manager from the `pytest` library, specifically `raises`, to assert that certain types of arguments will result in type errors when passed to the `Word` constructor. 

1. **First Test Case**: 
   ```python
   with raises(TypeError):
       Word(0, Ty('n'))
   ```
   - This test case checks if passing an integer (0) as the name parameter and a valid grammatical type (`Ty('n')`) results in a `TypeError`. The expected outcome is that the constructor should raise a `TypeError` because the name parameter must be a string.

2. **Second Test Case**: 
   ```python
   with raises(TypeError):
       Word('Alice', 1)
   ```
   - This test case verifies if passing a valid name (`'Alice'`) and an integer (1) as the grammatical type results in a `TypeError`. The expected outcome is that the constructor should raise a `TypeError` because the grammatical type parameter must be of type `Ty`.

3. **Third Test Case**: 
   ```python
   with raises(TypeError):
       Word('Alice', Ty('n'), dom=1)
   ```
   - This test case ensures that passing an additional positional argument (`dom=1`) to the constructor when it is not expected results in a `TypeError`. The expected outcome is that the constructor should raise a `TypeError` because the `dom` parameter, if provided, must be of type `Ty`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all tests are run within a testing environment like pytest to validate the behavior of the `Word` class.
- The `raises` context manager from pytest is used effectively to assert expected exceptions, which helps in robustly testing the constructor's argument validation logic.

## FunctionDef test_pregroup_swap_rotation
**test_pregroup_swap_rotation**: The function of `test_pregroup_swap_rotation` is to verify properties of the `Swap` class within the context of pregroup diagrams.

**Parameters**: 
- No parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**: 

The function `test_pregroup_swap_rotation` tests specific properties of the `Swap` class, which represents a swap operation in the context of pregroup diagrams. The `Swap` class is defined to inherit from `frobenius.Swap` and `Box`, indicating it operates within a Frobenius category framework.

The function performs the following checks:
1. **Domain and Codomain Properties**: It asserts that the right domain (`r.dom`) of the `Swap` instance equals the left codomain (`cod.r`) of the same instance, ensuring consistency in the transformation.
2. **Left and Right Domains**: It verifies that the left domain (`l.dom`) of the `Swap` instance matches the left codomain (`cod.l`) of the same instance.
3. **Codomain Consistency**: Similarly, it checks that the right codomain (`r.cod`) of the `Swap` instance is equal to the right domain (`dom.r`) of the same instance.

These assertions are crucial for ensuring that the `Swap` operations within pregroup diagrams adhere to the expected behavior and properties defined by the Frobenius category framework. The function uses concrete instances with types `s` (for source) and `n` (for noun) to demonstrate these properties, providing a practical example of how the swap operation should behave.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the types `s` and `n` are correctly defined within the scope of the test.
- The function relies on the `Swap` class's implementation being correct for the assertions to hold true. Any discrepancies in the implementation will result in assertion failures, indicating potential issues with the pregroup swap operation.
