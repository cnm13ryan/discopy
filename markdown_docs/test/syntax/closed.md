## FunctionDef test_to_rigid
**test_to_rigid**: The function of test_to_rigid is to verify the conversion of discopy diagrams into rigid diagrams.
**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `test_to_rigid` function serves as a test case to ensure that the `Diagram.to_rigid` method in the `discopy` library works correctly. It constructs various components and checks their conversion.

1. **Importing Required Modules**: The function starts by importing the necessary modules from the `discopy` package, specifically focusing on the `rigid` module.
2. **Defining Types and Boxes**: 
   - Two types are defined using `Ty`: `x` and `y`.
   - A box named `f` is created with these types as input and output respectively.
3. **Constructing a Diagram**:
   - The function creates an identity diagram for the product of `x` and `y`, denoted as `Id(x @ y)`.
   - It then combines this with the box `f` to form a more complex diagram: `Id(x @ y) @ f`.
4. **Testing Conversion**: 
   - The constructed diagram is converted into a rigid diagram using `Diagram.to_rigid`.
   - This conversion ensures that the structure and behavior of the original diagram are preserved in the rigid domain.
5. **Assertions**:
   - Assertions or checks might be implicitly performed to ensure the correctness of the transformation, although they are not explicitly shown in this snippet.

The function also indirectly tests the `Cup` class by verifying its interaction with other components during the conversion process. The `Cup` class is involved through the use of atomic types and their adjoints, ensuring that the rigid diagram maintains these relationships correctly.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed and imported before running this function.
- This test case assumes that the `Diagram.to_rigid` method works as expected. If any issues arise during conversion, they should be addressed in the implementation of `Diagram.to_rigid`.
- The function is designed to validate specific aspects of diagram construction and conversion within the `discopy` library, particularly focusing on atomic types and their adjoints.
