## FunctionDef test_spider_factory
**test_spider_factory**: The function of test_spider_factory is to verify that the Diagram.spider_factory method raises a ValueError when given invalid input parameters.

**parameters**: There are no explicit parameters defined for this Function.
- None

**Code Description**: 
The `test_spider_factory` function is designed to test the robustness and error handling capabilities of the `Diagram.spider_factory` method. It uses the `with raises(ValueError):` context manager from the `pytest.raises` module to check that a `ValueError` is raised when the `Diagram.spider_factory(2, 2, Ty('x'))` call is made with specific input parameters.

Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of this code:
1. **Context Manager**: The function uses a `with raises(ValueError):` context manager from the `pytest.raises` module to assert that a `ValueError` will be raised.
2. **Method Call**: Inside the context manager, it calls `Diagram.spider_factory(2, 2, Ty('x'))`. This method is expected to fail and raise a `ValueError`.
3. **Expected Outcome**: The purpose of this test case is to ensure that the `Diagram.spider_factory` method correctly handles invalid input parameters by raising an appropriate exception.

**Note**: Ensure that you have the necessary imports for the context manager, such as from `pytest import raises`. Also, verify that the `Ty('x')` object and any other required dependencies are properly defined in your test environment. This test case is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the spider factory method by catching invalid input scenarios early.

#### Usage Examples

1. **Connecting to the Database**

   ```python
   db_manager = DatabaseManager("sqlite:///example.db")
   if db_manager.connect():
       print("Database connected successfully.")
   else:
       print("Failed to connect to the database.")
   ```

2. **Executing a Query**

   ```python
   results = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM users")
   for row in results:
       print(row)
   ```

3. **Managing Transactions**

   ```python
   if db_manager.start_transaction():
       # Perform operations
       db_manager.commit_transaction()
   else:
       db_manager.rollback_transaction()
   ```

4. **Closing the Connection**

   ```python
   db_manager.close_connection()
   ```

#### Notes

- Ensure that the `create_connection` function or method is properly defined elsewhere in your application.
- Always handle exceptions and ensure proper resource management to avoid memory leaks and other issues.

### Object: User Authentication System

#### Overview
The User Authentication System is a critical component of our application that ensures secure user access to various functionalities. This system manages user registration, login, password reset, and session management.

#### Key Features
1. **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account by providing essential information such as username, email, and password.
2. **Login Functionality**: Enables registered users to log in using their credentials.
3. **Password Reset**: Provides a mechanism for users to reset their passwords if they forget them.
4. **Session Management**: Manages user sessions to ensure secure and efficient access control.

#### Technical Details
- **User Model**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `username` (Unique, Non-null)
  - `email` (Unique, Non-null)
  - `hashed_password` (Non-null)
  - `is_active` (Boolean, Default: False)

- **Authentication Methods**:
  - **Register**: Validates user inputs and hashes passwords before storing them in the database.
  - **Login**: Verifies username and password against stored data. If successful, creates a session token.
  - **Logout**: Invalidates the current session token.

- **Security Measures**:
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.
  - Session tokens use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
  - Two-factor authentication is optional and can be enabled by users.

#### Usage Instructions
1. **Register a New User**:
   ```python
   register_user(username='john_doe', email='johndoe@example.com', password='securepassword123')
   ```

2. **Log In**:
   ```python
   login_user(username='john_doe', password='securepassword123')
   ```

3. **Reset Password**:
   ```python
   request_password_reset(email='johndoe@example.com')
   reset_password(token='reset_token', new_password='new_securepassword123')
   ```

4. **Log Out**:
   ```python
   logout_user()
   ```

#### Error Handling
- **Invalid Credentials**: "Incorrect username or password."
- **Account Not Active**: "Your account is not active. Please check your email for verification instructions."
- **Password Reset Token Expired**: "The reset token has expired. Please request a new one."

#### Example Scenarios

1. **User Registration**:
   - A user signs up with the username `john_doe`, email `johndoe@example.com`, and password `securepassword123`. The system validates the inputs, hashes the password, and stores the user information in the database.

2. **Login Attempt**:
   - Upon logging in with `username='john_doe'` and `password='securepassword123'`, the system verifies the credentials. If successful, a session token is generated and stored in a secure cookie.

3. **Password Reset**:
   - A user requests a password reset by providing their email address `johndoe@example.com`. The system sends an email with a unique token to the provided email address. Once the user clicks on the link within the email, they can set a new password.

4. **Session Expiry**:
   - If a user does not interact with the application for a certain period (e.g., 30 minutes), their session expires, and they are required to log in again.

#### Conclusion
The User Authentication System is designed to ensure secure and reliable access management for our users. By following these guidelines, developers can effectively integrate this system into their applications to enhance security and user experience.

For further technical support or customization options, please refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.example.com/auth).
