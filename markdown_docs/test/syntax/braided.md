## FunctionDef test_hexagon
**test_hexagon**: The function of `test_hexagon` is to validate the correctness of the braiding operation defined by the `Diagram.braid` method.
**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `test_hexagon` function performs two assertions to ensure that the braiding operation implemented in the `Diagram.braid` method works correctly. Specifically, it checks:
1. The braiding of three atomic types using the `@` operator and compares it with the expected result involving a series of braid operations.
2. The braiding of an atomic type followed by another atomic type using the `@` operator and again compares it with the expected result.

These tests are crucial for verifying that the implementation of the braiding operation adheres to the mathematical properties of braided monoidal categories, which is a fundamental concept in categorical quantum mechanics and related fields. The function ensures that the braid operations are correctly composed and respect the associativity and symmetry rules inherent in these categories.

The first assertion checks:
```python
assert Diagram.braid(x, y @ z) == Braid(x, y) @ z >> y @ Braid(x, z)
```
This line asserts that braiding `x` with the result of `y @ z` is equivalent to performing a braid between `x` and `y`, then composing it with another braid operation involving `z`.

The second assertion checks:
```python
assert Diagram.braid(x @ y, z) == Braid(x @ y, z) >> x @ Braid(y, z)
```
This line asserts that braiding the result of `x @ y` with `z` is equivalent to performing a braid between `x @ y` and `z`, then composing it with another braid operation involving `y`.

These assertions are essential for ensuring the correctness of the implementation in scenarios where atomic types interact, thereby maintaining consistency across different compositions of braids.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the `Diagram.braid` method is correctly implemented according to the rules of braided monoidal categories. Any deviations from these rules would result in failing assertions and potential bugs in the system.
## FunctionDef test_simplify
**test_simplify**: The function of test_simplify is to verify the simplification functionality of braid diagrams.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `test_simplify` function serves as an assertion check for the simplification method in a diagrammatic algebra context, specifically focusing on braided diagrams. The code asserts that certain operations and their inverses simplify to equivalent identities and other simplified forms:

1. **Diagram.braid(x, y @ z)**: This creates a braid diagram with strands `x`, `y`, and `z` where `y` and `z` are adjacent.
2. **Diagram.braid(x, y @ z)[::-1]**: This reverses the order of the operations in the braid diagram, effectively creating its inverse.
3. **simplify()**: The simplify method is called on both the original and reversed diagrams to ensure they reduce to the same form.

The function asserts that:
- The simplified result of `Diagram.braid(x, y @ z) >> Diagram.braid(x, y @ z)[::-1]` is equal to the identity diagram `Diagram.id(x @ y @ z)`.
- Similarly, the reversed braid operation `Diagram.braid(y @ z, x)[::-1] >> Diagram.braid(y @ z, x)` also simplifies to the same identity diagram.

This test ensures that the braiding and unbraiding operations are correctly implemented and that they result in the expected simplified forms.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `Diagram` class and its associated methods (`braid`, `id`, `>>`, and `[::-1]`) are properly defined and functioning as intended.
- The test assumes that the `simplify()` method works correctly, which is crucial for this assertion to hold true.
