## FunctionDef test_trace
**test_trace**: The function of `test_trace` is to test whether Box('f', 'x', 'y').trace() raises an AxiomError.
**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The function `test_trace` is designed to validate that the execution of `Box('f', 'x', 'y').trace()` will raise an instance of `AxiomError`. The test uses a context manager, `raises`, which asserts that a specific exception type is raised when the code inside the `with` block is executed. If no `AxiomError` is raised, the test will fail.

Here's a detailed analysis:
- **Import and Setup**: The function does not import any additional modules or classes beyond what is provided in the snippet.
- **Test Execution**: Inside the context manager, the code attempts to call `Box('f', 'x', 'y').trace()`. This line of code is expected to raise an `AxiomError` based on some internal logic or validation within the `Box` class. The use of `raises(AxiomError)` ensures that this expectation is met during testing.
- **Exception Handling**: If no `AxiomError` is raised, the test will fail, indicating a potential issue with either the implementation of `Box.trace()` or the setup of the test environment.

**Note**: Ensure that the `Box` class and its methods are correctly defined to raise an `AxiomError` when appropriate. This test should be part of a larger suite of tests to verify the behavior of the `trace` method under various conditions.
