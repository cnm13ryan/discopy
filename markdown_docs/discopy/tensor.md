### FunctionDef __init__(self, array, dom, cod)
# Documentation for `calculateDiscount`

## Overview

The `calculateDiscount` function is designed to compute the discounted price of an item based on its original price and the discount rate provided by the user.

## Function Signature

```python
def calculateDiscount(original_price: float, discount_rate: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the discounted price of an item.
    
    Parameters:
        original_price (float): The original price of the item before applying any discounts.
        discount_rate (float): The rate at which to apply the discount. This should be a value between 0 and 1, 
                               where 0 represents no discount and 1 represents a full refund.
    
    Returns:
        float: The discounted price of the item.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If `original_price` is negative or if `discount_rate` is not within the range [0, 1].
    """
```

## Parameters

- **original_price** (float): A floating-point number representing the original price of the item before applying any discounts. This value must be non-negative.
  
- **discount_rate** (float): A floating-point number between 0 and 1 inclusive, indicating the percentage discount to apply. For example, a value of `0.2` represents a 20% discount.

## Returns

- **float**: The calculated discounted price of the item. This is derived by multiplying the original price by `(1 - discount_rate)`.

## Raises

- **ValueError**: If the `original_price` is negative or if the `discount_rate` is outside the range [0, 1].

## Examples

### Example 1: Applying a 20% Discount

```python
result = calculateDiscount(100.0, 0.2)
print(result)  # Output: 80.0
```

In this example, an item originally priced at $100 is discounted by 20%, resulting in a final price of $80.

### Example 2: Applying No Discount

```python
result = calculateDiscount(50.0, 0)
print(result)  # Output: 50.0
```

Here, no discount is applied to an item priced at $50, so the final price remains $50.

## Notes

- Ensure that the `original_price` and `discount_rate` values are validated before calling this function to avoid runtime errors.
- The function performs a basic validation check on the input parameters. If these checks fail, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message.

This documentation provides clear instructions for using the `calculateDiscount` function, ensuring that users understand how to correctly apply discounts and handle potential errors.

### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to compute the Hermitian conjugate (or adjoint) of a given tensor.
**Parameters**:
· self: A Tensor instance on which the dagger operation is performed.

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method computes and returns the Hermitian conjugate of a given tensor. The process involves several steps:

1. **Source and Target Calculation**: It first calculates the source indices (`source`) as a range from 0 to the length of the tensor's domain (dom) multiplied by its codomain (cod). Then, it computes the target indices (`target`), which are adjusted based on whether the index is within the domain or codomain.

2. **Backend Context**: The `backend()` context manager is used with NumPy as the default backend to ensure that operations are performed correctly. This context manager handles the switching of backends and ensures that operations are executed in the appropriate environment.

3. **Array Transformation**: Using NumPy, it performs two main transformations:
   - **Conjugation**: The array of the tensor is conjugated using `np.conjugate`.
   - **Axis Rearrangement**: The axes of the array are rearranged from the source indices to the target indices using `np.moveaxis`.

4. **Return**: Finally, it returns a new Tensor instance with the transformed array and updated domain and codomain.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the tensor's array is properly handled within the context manager.
- The method assumes that the underlying backend supports complex numbers for conjugation operations.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor has an array `[[1+2j, 3-4j], [5+6j, 7-8j]]` and domain-codomain dimensions of (2, 2), the output would be a new Tensor with its array transformed according to the Hermitian conjugate operation.

### FunctionDef transpose(self, left)
**transpose**: The function of transpose is to return the diagrammatic transpose of a Tensor.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (bool) - A boolean flag indicating whether to apply the transpose operation on the left side; defaults to False.

**Code Description**: 
The `transpose` method in the `Tensor` class performs a specific type of transposition that is relevant within the context of diagrammatic tensor networks. It does not perform the standard algebraic transpose for non-atomic dimensions, as noted in its documentation. Instead, it returns a new `Tensor` object with three key changes:
1. The array representing the tensor undergoes a transpose operation.
2. The codomain (cod) of the tensor is reversed.
3. The domain (dom) of the tensor is also reversed.

This method allows for transformations that are meaningful in the context of diagrammatic representations, which often involve reversing the direction or structure of connections between tensors.

The `transpose` method is called by other test functions within the project, such as `test_Tensor_transpose`, to verify its correctness. For example, it checks whether transposing a tensor with two caps results in a tensor with two cups, ensuring that the logical relationship and transformation are correctly implemented.

**Note**: 
- Be cautious when using this method on tensors with non-atomic dimensions, as it does not perform an algebraic transpose.
- Ensure that the `left` parameter is set appropriately based on your specific use case to avoid unintended behavior.

**Output Example**: 
If you call `Tensor.caps(Dim(2), Dim(2)).transpose()`, the output will be equivalent to `Tensor.cups(Dim(2), Dim(2))`. This means that transposing a tensor with two caps results in a tensor with two cups, effectively reversing the direction of the connections represented by these tensors.
***
### FunctionDef conjugate(self, diagrammatic)
**conjugate**: The function of conjugate is to return the complex conjugate of a tensor.
**parameters**:
· diagrammatic: bool, default False; Whether to use the diagrammatic method for computing the conjugate.

**Code Description**: 
The `conjugate` method computes the complex conjugate of a given tensor. If `diagrammatic` is set to `False`, it directly calculates the complex conjugate using the provided array. However, if `diagrammatic` is `True`, which is not used in this implementation, it would involve more complex operations related to diagrammatic representations.

This method interacts with other functions and tests within the project:
- It is called by the `test_Tensor_conjugate` test function, ensuring that the conjugate of a tensor with a single element (1j) returns its negative (-1j).
- The `Channel.double` class also indirectly uses this method to construct pure quantum channels through doubling operations.

The implementation ensures that the output is precise and accurate by leveraging the underlying array representation of the tensor. This method plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency with complex mathematical operations required in quantum computing and related fields.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input tensor has a valid complex number type for meaningful results.
- The `diagrammatic` parameter, though not used here, is included to support potential future extensions where diagrammatic methods might be employed.

**Output Example**: 
For a tensor with an array `[1j]`, calling `conjugate(diagrammatic=False)` returns a new tensor with the array `[-1j]`.

### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of `__repr__` is to provide a string representation of an instance of the `Functor` class.
· parameter1: self (The instance of the `Functor` class)
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method generates a string that describes the state and attributes of the `Functor` object. This string includes details such as the factory name, the object (`ob`), arrow type (`ar`), domain (`dom`), and data type (`dtype`). The `factory_name` function is used to determine the class name, which helps in identifying the specific subclass of `Functor`.

The method constructs a string that begins with the factory name (e.g., "tensor.Functor"), followed by parameters such as `ob`, `ar`, `dom`, and `dtype`. The use of `f"..."` indicates an f-string, allowing for easy embedding of variable values directly into the string. This representation is useful for debugging and logging purposes.

The `factory_name` function called within this method retrieves the full class name by combining the module name (with 'discopy' prefix removed) and the class name. For instance, if a subclass of `Functor` named `MyFunctor` exists in the `tensor` module, `factory_name(MyFunctor)` would return "tensor.MyFunctor".

**Note**: Ensure that all attributes (`ob`, `ar`, `dom`, `dtype`) are properly defined and accessible within the `Functor` class. The `dtype` attribute should be an object with a `__name__` attribute, such as a Python built-in type or custom data type.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `MyFunctor` is created with `ob='example'`, `ar=1`, `dom='A'`, and `dtype=int`, the output string might look like:
```
tensor.MyFunctor(ob='example', ar=1, dom='A', dtype=int)
```

### FunctionDef to_quimb(self, dtype)
**to_quimb**: The function of `to_quimb` is to convert a tensor diagram into a quimb tensor.
**Parameters**:
· `dtype`: Used for spiders (optional).

**Code Description**: 
The `to_quimb` method converts a `Diagram` object from the discopy library into an equivalent `Tensor` object in the quimb library. This conversion process is crucial for interfacing with quantum computing libraries, particularly those that use the quimb package.

1. **Initialization and Input Preparation**:
   - The function first imports necessary modules from the quimb library.
   - It initializes a list of input tensors (`inputs`) by creating `COPY_tensor` objects based on each dimension in the diagram's domain (input sides). Each tensor is labeled with indices starting as 'inp0' for the first input and ending as 'inpN_end' where N is the number of inputs.

2. **Building the Tensor Network**:
   - The function iterates over all boxes (operations) in the diagram.
   - For each box, it creates a `Tensor` object using the evaluated array from the box's operation.
   - It then connects this new tensor with existing tensors based on their indices, ensuring that the correct connections are made between input and output indices.

3. **Reindexing**:
   - After all boxes have been processed, the function reindexes the entire network to ensure that all tensor indices are appropriately labeled for use in the quimb library.
   
4. **Return Value**:
   - The method returns a `Tensor` object representing the entire diagram converted into a form compatible with the quimb library.

This conversion is essential because it allows discopy diagrams, which are often used to represent categorical structures and quantum circuits, to be seamlessly integrated with libraries like quimb that provide more advanced numerical and simulation capabilities for tensor networks and quantum mechanics.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `Diagram` object is well-formed and compatible with the operations supported by quimb. Any issues in the diagram structure can lead to errors during conversion.

**Output Example**: 
The output of `to_quimb` would be a `Tensor` object from the quimb library, representing the entire discopy `Diagram`. For instance:
```python
tensor = my_discopy_diagram.to_quimb()
print(tensor)
# Output: Tensor with shape [dim1, dim2, ..., dimN] and associated indices.
```
This tensor can then be used for further quantum computing operations or simulations within the quimb framework.

### FunctionDef grad(self, var)
**grad**: The function of grad is to compute the gradient of a Diagram with respect to a given variable.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: var - The variable with respect to which the gradient is computed (must be present in self.free_symbols).
· parameter2: params - Additional parameters that can be passed to the computation.

**Code Description**: This method computes the gradient of a `Diagram` object, represented by `self`, with respect to a specified variable `var`. The process involves breaking down the Diagram into parts and applying specific operations based on whether or not `var` is present in the free symbols of the Diagram. If `var` is not a free symbol, an empty tensor is returned. Otherwise, two terms are constructed: one where `box.grad(var)` is applied directly to the box inside the Diagram, and another where the entire Diagram's gradient is computed with respect to `var`. These two terms are then summed together to produce the final result.

The method first checks if `var` exists in the free symbols of the Diagram. If it does not, an empty tensor is returned as specified by `self.sum_factory((), self.dom, self.cod)`. This ensures that operations involving non-existent variables do not proceed further and return a neutral element for addition.

If `var` is present, the method proceeds to split the Diagram into left, box (which represents a specific operation or Box within the Diagram), right parts, and the tail part of the Diagram. The gradient computation involves constructing two terms:
1. A term where the identity transformation (`self.id(left)`) on the left side, the gradient of the `box` with respect to `var`, and the identity transformation on the right side are concatenated.
2. Another term where the original Diagram remains unchanged but its tail part is replaced by the tail's gradient with respect to `var`.

These two terms are then combined using addition (`>>`) to produce the final result.

This method plays a crucial role in understanding how changes in input variables affect the overall output of the Diagram, which is essential for tasks such as optimization and sensitivity analysis. It leverages the structure of the Diagram to compute gradients efficiently, ensuring that only relevant parts are differentiated based on the presence of `var`.

**Note**: Ensure that any variable passed to this function is correctly defined within the context of the Diagram to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: The output will be a new Diagram representing the gradient with respect to the specified variable. For instance, if we have a Diagram involving symbolic variables and operations, calling `grad` on it would result in another Diagram that shows how each component changes with respect to those variables.

***
### FunctionDef __new__(cls, name, dom, cod, data)
**__new__**: The function of __new__ is to create a new instance of the Box class based on input parameters.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: name (str or None) - The name of the box.
· parameter2: dom (int or None) - The domain of the box, typically representing the number of inputs.
· parameter3: cod (int or None) - The codomain of the box, indicating the number of outputs.
· parameter4: data (Any or None) - Additional data associated with the box instance.
· parameter5: args (tuple) - Additional positional arguments passed to the object.
· parameter6: kwargs (dict) - Additional keyword arguments passed to the object.

**Code Description**: The `__new__` method of the Box class is responsible for creating a new instance based on the provided parameters. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Check**: The first condition checks if either `cls.dtype` is not None or `data` is explicitly provided. If this condition is true, it means that the data type has already been determined or needs to be set explicitly.

2. **Direct Instance Creation**: If the above condition is met (i.e., `cls.dtype is not None or data is None`), a new instance of the class is created directly using `object.__new__(cls)`. This bypasses any custom initialization logic and creates an empty instance that can be further initialized.

3. **Data Processing**: If no explicit data type has been determined (`cls.dtype is None` and `data` is provided), `_get_data_dtype` is called to process the input `data` and determine its appropriate data type based on the current backend context. This function ensures that the data is correctly formatted for operations using the specified backend.

4. **Recursive Call**: The processed data and determined data type are then passed back into a recursive call of `cls.__new__`. By passing the new class type with the determined dtype, this step ensures that all subsequent methods and attributes are consistent with the correct data type.

5. **State Update**: Finally, the instance is updated to include both the processed data and its corresponding data type, ensuring that it is ready for further operations using the specified backend.

The `__new__` method effectively handles the creation of a new Box instance by either directly creating an empty instance or processing input data to ensure consistency with the current backend context. This ensures that all subsequent methods operate on correctly typed and formatted data.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `data` is properly formatted before calling `_get_data_dtype`. The method assumes that the class instance has a defined `dtype` attribute, which may need to be set or updated during object initialization.

**Output Example**: If the input `data` is an array-like structure and the current backend is NumPy, `_get_data_dtype` might return:
```
([1, 2, 3], 'int64')
```
indicating that the data has been processed and its type set to `'int64'` as per the NumPy backend's requirements.
***
### FunctionDef _get_data_dtype(data)
**_get_data_dtype**: The function of _get_data_dtype is to determine the data type of an input array based on the backend being used.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: data (Any) - The input data from which the data type needs to be determined.

**Code Description**: 
The `_get_data_dtype` function plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate data type for an input array when working with different matrix backends. This is particularly important because the behavior of operations on arrays can vary significantly depending on the backend (e.g., NumPy, JAX). The function takes the input `data`, which could be any form of array-like structure, and returns a tuple containing the processed data and its corresponding data type.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function accepts an input `data` that is assumed to be in some format suitable for processing.
   
2. **Backend Context**:
   - It uses the current backend context managed by the `backend` function, which ensures that operations are performed according to the active backend's specifications.

3. **Data Type Determination**:
   - If no explicit data type (`dtype`) is defined for the class instance (i.e., `self.dtype is None`), `_get_data_dtype` processes the input `data`.
   - The function then calls itself recursively with a new class type that includes the determined `dtype`, ensuring that all operations are performed using this data type.

4. **State Update**:
   - After determining the appropriate data type, it updates the instance's state to include both the processed data and its corresponding data type.
   
5. **Class Type Adjustment**:
   - The class type of the object is updated to reflect the new `dtype`, ensuring that all methods and attributes are consistent with this data type.

The function effectively bridges the gap between generic operations on arrays and backend-specific implementations, making sure that the correct data handling strategies are applied based on the current backend context.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input `data` is correctly formatted before calling `_get_data_dtype`.
- The function assumes that the class instance has a defined `dtype` attribute, which may need to be set or updated during object initialization.
- This function should be called whenever there's a need to process data with a specific backend, ensuring consistency and correct behavior across different computational environments.

**Output Example**: 
If the input `data` is an array-like structure and the current backend is NumPy, `_get_data_dtype` might return:
```
([1, 2, 3], 'int64')
```
indicating that the data has been processed and its type set to 'int64' as per the NumPy backend's requirements.
***
### FunctionDef array(self)
**array**: The function of array is to convert the data stored in the Box instance into a NumPy array and reshape it according to the domain and codomain dimensions.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Box class.

**Code Description**: This method checks if there is any data associated with the current Box instance. If `self.data` is not `None`, it uses the backend context manager from discopy/matrix.py/backend to create a NumPy array from the data and then reshapes this array based on the sum of the inside dimensions of both the domain (input) and codomain (output) of the Box.

1. **Data Check**: The method first checks if `self.data` is not `None`. If it is, no further processing is needed.
2. **Backend Context Manager**: Using the `backend()` context manager from discopy/matrix.py/backend, a NumPy backend is acquired for matrix operations.
3. **Array Conversion and Reshaping**: Inside the context manager, the method converts `self.data` into a NumPy array using `np.array(self.data)`. The reshaped array is then created by calling `.reshape(self.dom.inside + self.cod.inside)` on the resulting NumPy array.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that data stored within Box instances can be easily manipulated and used in tensor operations, leveraging the power of NumPy for efficient numerical computations. It also ensures that the reshaped array aligns with the expected dimensions required by subsequent operations involving the domain and codomain of the Box instance.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.data` is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid potential errors during execution.

**Output Example**: If `self.data = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `self.dom.inside + self.cod.inside = (2, 2)`, the output would be a 2x2 NumPy array:
```
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
```
***
### FunctionDef grad(self, var)
**grad**: The function of grad is to compute the gradient (partial derivative) of a Box instance with respect to a specified variable.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - This refers to the current Box instance on which the grad method is called.
· parameter2: var - A string representing the variable with respect to which the gradient should be computed.
· params - Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the drawing name for the gradient operation.

**Code Description**: 
The `grad` function computes the partial derivative of a Box instance with respect to a specified variable. It does this by using the `bubble` method, passing in a lambda function as an argument. This lambda function is responsible for computing the differential (or "diff") of the input Box with respect to the given variable.

Here’s a detailed analysis:
1. **Lambda Function**: The lambda function inside the `bubble` method takes a single parameter `x`. This lambda function uses Python's built-in `getattr` to attempt to retrieve an attribute named `"diff"` from the input `x`.
2. **Differential Computation**: If the `"diff"` attribute exists, it is called with `var` as its argument and returns the result of this call. If the `"diff"` attribute does not exist (or if the method provided by `getattr` returns a function that raises an error when called), the lambda function defaults to returning 0.
3. **Drawing Name**: The drawing name for the gradient operation is set using the format string `f"$\partial {var}$"`. This string uses LaTeX formatting to denote the partial derivative with respect to the variable `var`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the Box instances involved have a `"diff"` attribute or method defined, as this is crucial for the correct computation of gradients.
- The `params` argument can be used to customize additional properties related to the drawing, such as color or style, but it is not strictly necessary for computing the gradient itself.

**Output Example**: 
If you call `grad(self, 'x')`, and assuming that the Box instance has a `"diff"` attribute defined, the output will essentially represent the partial derivative of the Box with respect to `x`. For example, if the current Box represents some function `f(x)`, then the result would be a new Box representing `\(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\)`.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, inside, func)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the attributes of a Bubble instance.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: inside - This is the primary content or structure that the Bubble will encapsulate.
· parameter2: func (default value: lambda x: int(not x)) - This is an optional function applied to the 'inside' content. The default function flips the boolean state of its input, converting `True` to `False` and vice versa.
· params (optional) - Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the Bubble instance.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up a new instance of the `Bubble` class. It takes in an `inside` argument, which serves as the core content or structure that will be encapsulated by the Bubble object. Additionally, it accepts a function (`func`) to apply transformations on the `inside` content; if not provided, a default boolean inversion function is used.

The method first assigns the passed `func` parameter to an instance variable `self.func`, allowing for potential modifications or operations on the `inside` content later. Then, it calls the superclass's `__init__` method using `super().__init__(inside, **params)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is also executed, providing a consistent and comprehensive setup process.

By default, if no specific function is provided via the `func` parameter, the lambda function `lambda x: int(not x)` is used. This function takes an input `x`, which could be a boolean or any value that can be truthy or falsy in Python, and returns its logical negation as an integer (1 for False, 0 for True).

**Note**: Ensure that the `func` parameter, if provided, matches the expected signature and behavior required by the Bubble's internal operations. Incorrect or incompatible functions could lead to unexpected behavior of the Bubble instance.
