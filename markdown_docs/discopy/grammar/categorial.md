### FunctionDef fa(left, right)
**fa**: The function of fa is to perform forward application.
**Parameters**: 
· left: The left operand in the forward application, which should be an instance of the appropriate type.
· right: The right operand in the forward application, which should also be an instance of the appropriate type.

**Code Description**: The `fa` function in the `Diagram` class is responsible for performing a forward application operation. It takes two parameters, `left` and `right`, both expected to be instances that support the `<<` operator, indicating a left-to-right composition or application. This function then returns an instance of the `FA` class with its constructor initialized by applying the `<<` operator between the `left` and `right` operands.

The specific implementation involves:
1. **Parameter Validation**: The function starts by ensuring that both `left` and `right` are valid instances, although this is not detailed in the provided code snippet.
2. **Application Operation**: It uses the `<<` operator to apply the right operand to the left operand, effectively performing a forward application operation.
3. **Result Construction**: The result of the operation is used as an argument to initialize a new instance of the `FA` class.

This function plays a crucial role in building and manipulating diagrams within the `Diagram` class, allowing for complex operations to be constructed step-by-step through the composition of simpler components.

**Note**: Ensure that both `left` and `right` parameters are correctly typed instances supporting the `<<` operator. Otherwise, the behavior may be unpredictable or raise exceptions.

**Output Example**: If `left` is a `Box` instance representing some computation and `right` is another `Box`, then `fa(left, right)` would return an `FA` instance that represents the application of `right` to `left`. For example:
```python
result = fa(Box("A", "B"), Box("C", "D"))
print(result)  # Output: FA(AB)
```
Here, `Box("A", "B") << Box("C", "D")` results in a new `FA` instance indicating the application of the second box to the first.
***
### FunctionDef ba(left, right)
**ba**: The function of `ba` is to perform backward application on two diagrams.
**Parameters**: 
· left: A Diagram representing the left operand.
· right: A Diagram representing the right operand.

**Code Description**: 
The `ba` function takes two `Diagram` objects, `left` and `right`, as parameters. It returns a new `BA` object that represents the backward application of these two diagrams. The `BA` class is defined to encapsulate this backward application rule, ensuring that the operation adheres to specific structural rules.

In detail:
- The function `ba` is part of the `Diagram` class and operates on instances of `Diagram`.
- It uses the `>>` operator, which is a method or operator overloaded in the `Diagram` class. This operator likely represents some form of composition or application between two diagrams.
- The result of applying `ba` to `left` and `right` creates an instance of the `BA` class with the `under` attribute set to the backward application of `right` over `left`. 
- The domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the resulting `BA` object are computed based on the composition rules defined in the `Diagram` class.

**Note**: Ensure that both `left` and `right` parameters are valid instances of `Diagram` to avoid runtime errors. Also, be aware that the backward application operation is specific to the diagrammatic language being used and may have certain constraints or properties that must be satisfied for the operation to be valid.

**Output Example**: If `diagram1` and `diagram2` are two instances of `Diagram`, then calling `ba(diagram1, diagram2)` will return a new instance of `BA` representing the backward application of `diagram2` over `diagram1`. For example:
```python
result = ba(diagram1, diagram2)
print(result)  # Output might be something like: BA(under=Box(...))
```
In this example, `result` is an instance of `BA` with its internal structure representing the backward application rule applied to `diagram1` and `diagram2`.
***
### FunctionDef fc(left, middle, right)
**fc**: The function of `fc` is to perform forward composition on two diagrams.
**Parameters**: 
· left: An instance of the Diagram class representing one part of the composition.
· middle: An instance of the Diagram class representing the intermediate diagram.
· right: An instance of the Diagram class representing another part of the composition.

**Code Description**: The `fc` function in this context is designed to facilitate the forward composition of diagrams, a fundamental operation in categorical grammars and diagrammatic reasoning. It takes three parameters—`left`, `middle`, and `right`, each being an instance of the `Diagram` class. This function essentially concatenates these diagrams in sequence: first `left` followed by `middle`, then `right`. The result is returned as a new `FC` object, which stands for forward composition.

The implementation of `fc` involves calling two constructors:
1. **BinaryBoxConstructor**: This constructor is used to create the resulting diagram from the given `left` and `middle` diagrams.
2. **Box**: This constructor finalizes the creation process by setting up the domain and codomain, as well as defining the name for the new `FC` object.

The function ensures that the `exponent` of the left diagram matches the `base` of the middle diagram before proceeding with the composition to maintain consistency in the categorical structure. If this condition is not met, an `AxiomError` is raised using a formatted message indicating the mismatch.

**Note**: Ensure that all input diagrams are correctly instantiated and compatible for composition; otherwise, an error will be thrown. This function should be used within contexts where the diagrams represent valid categorical structures.

**Output Example**: 
If `left`, `middle`, and `right` are instances of `Diagram` with appropriate compositions, the output would be a new `FC` object representing the forward composition of these three diagrams. For instance:
```python
result = fc(left_diagram, middle_diagram, right_diagram)
```
In this example, `result` is an `FC` object that represents the sequence `left_diagram << middle_diagram << right_diagram`.
***
### FunctionDef bc(left, middle, right)
**bc**: The function of `bc` is to perform backward composition on two Diagrams.
**Parameters**:
· left: A `Diagram` representing the left component of the composition.
· middle: A `Diagram` representing the middle component of the composition.
· right: A `Diagram` representing the right component of the composition.

**Code Description**: 
The `bc` function takes three `Diagram` objects as input and returns a new `BC` object that represents the backward composition of these Diagrams. Backward composition is a fundamental operation in diagrammatic logic, where the output of one Diagram serves as the input to another, but with the order reversed compared to forward composition.

The `bc` function performs the following steps:
1. It accepts three `Diagram` objects: `left`, `middle`, and `right`.
2. It constructs a new `BC` object using the backward composition rule, which is defined by the given Diagrams.
3. The `BC` object takes the tensor product of the left and middle Diagrams as its domain, and the tensor product of the middle and right Diagrams as its codomain.

This function interacts with other components in the project, specifically:
- It calls the `>>` operator on the `Diagram` class, which is used to construct the domain and codomain for the new `BC` object.
- The `BC` class itself, which is a subclass of `BinaryBoxConstructor` and `Box`, is responsible for defining the structure and behavior of the backward composition.

**Note**: Ensure that the Diagrams provided as inputs are compatible in terms of their bases and exponents to avoid errors. The function will raise an `AxiomError` if the Diagrams cannot be composed according to the rules of diagrammatic logic.

**Output Example**: If you have three Diagrams: `left`, `middle`, and `right`, where `left >> middle` forms a valid domain and `middle >> right` forms a valid codomain, then calling `bc(left, middle, right)` will return a new `BC` object representing the backward composition of these Diagrams.
***
### FunctionDef fx(left, middle, right)
**fx**: The function of fx is to perform forward crossed composition.
**Parameters**:
· left: The left part of the diagram, which must be an instance of `Over`.
· middle: This parameter represents the middle part of the diagram and can be any valid box.
· right: The right part of the diagram, which must be an instance of `Under`.

**Code Description**: 
The fx function performs a forward crossed composition operation in the context of categorical diagrams. It takes three parameters: left, middle, and right. These parameters represent different parts of the diagram that need to be composed.

1. **Validation**: The first step is to validate the types of the `left` and `right` parameters using assertions. Specifically, it checks if `left` is an instance of `Over` and `right` is an instance of `Under`. If these conditions are not met, an `AxiomError` is raised.
2. **Name Construction**: A name for the resulting diagram is constructed by concatenating the names of the left and right parts with "FX".
3. **Domain and Codomain Calculation**: The domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the new diagram are calculated using the `@` operator, which performs tensor product on the domains, and the `>>` operator for the codomains.
4. **Initialization**: Finally, the function initializes a new instance of the `FX` class with the constructed name, domain, and codomain.

This function is called within the context of diagram construction in categorical grammars, where it helps to build complex diagrams by composing simpler ones in a specific direction (forward crossed composition).

**Note**: The parameters must adhere strictly to their type requirements; otherwise, an error will be thrown. This ensures that only compatible parts are composed.

**Output Example**: If `left` is an instance of `Over` with domain A and codomain B, `middle` is a valid box, and `right` is an instance of `Under` with base B and exponent C, the output would be a new diagram with domain A and codomain C.
***
### FunctionDef bx(left, middle, right)
**bx**: The function of bx is to perform backward crossed composition on two diagrams.
**Parameters**: 
· left: An instance of `Over` representing the left part of the composition.
· middle: An instance of `Under` representing the middle part that connects the left and right parts.
· right: An instance of `Under` representing the right part of the composition.

**Code Description**: The `bx` function takes three parameters, `left`, `middle`, and `right`. It performs a backward crossed composition operation by creating an instance of the `BX` class with `middle << left` as its domain and `middle >> right` as its codomain. This operation essentially combines the given diagrams in a specific order to form a new diagram.

The function first checks that `left` is an instance of `Over` and `right` is an instance of `Under`. It then verifies if the base of `left` matches the exponent of `right`, raising an `AxiomError` if they do not match. If the conditions are met, it constructs a new `BX` object with the appropriate domain and codomain.

The `BX` class is defined as a subclass of `BinaryBoxConstructor` and `Box`. It initializes itself by setting the name based on its components (`left` and `right`) and calculating the domain and codomain. The `BinaryBoxConstructor` part ensures that the new box is correctly constructed with the specified left and right parts.

**Note**: Ensure that all input parameters are of the correct type to avoid errors. Specifically, `left` must be an instance of `Over`, and `right` must be an instance of `Under`.

**Output Example**: If you call `bx(over1, under2, under3)`, where `over1` is an instance of `Over` and `under2` and `under3` are instances of `Under`, the function will return a new `BX` object with the domain as `under2 << over1` and codomain as `under2 >> under3`.

## ClassDef Eval
**Eval**: The function of Eval is to represent an evaluation box within a categorial grammar framework.
**Attributes**: This class does not explicitly define any attributes; it inherits from `closed.Eval` and `Box`.
- **closed.Eval**: Represents a closed evaluation box in the context of categorial grammar, which is essential for handling specific types of grammatical rules or transformations.
- **Box**: Inherits properties and methods related to boxes within categorial diagrams.

**Code Description**: The `Eval` class inherits from both `closed.Eval` and `Box`, combining functionalities from these two classes. This inheritance structure suggests that `Eval` is designed to handle evaluation operations in the context of categorial grammar, leveraging the base functionalities provided by `Box`.

Inheriting from `Box` implies that `Eval` can be integrated into a broader diagrammatic structure used for representing and manipulating grammatical rules or expressions within a categorical framework. The inheritance from `closed.Eval` indicates that it specifically deals with closed evaluation boxes, which are likely to represent complete or terminal nodes in the categorial grammar.

The description provided for `Eval` states that it is "equivalent to :class:``FA``, " where `FA` presumably stands for some other class or concept within this context. This equivalence suggests that `Eval` and `FA` share similar functionalities, possibly in terms of how they handle evaluation operations within the categorial grammar.

**Note**: When using the `Eval` class, ensure it is appropriately integrated into a categorial diagram to leverage its full capabilities. The relationship with other classes such as `Box` and potentially `FA` should be considered for a comprehensive understanding and effective use in the context of categorial grammar operations.

## FunctionDef unaryBoxConstructor(attr)
**unaryBoxConstructor**: The function of unaryBoxConstructor is to create a class constructor that can build instances from a tree structure or convert an instance back into a tree representation.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: attr (str)
    - The attribute name used for accessing the subtree in the tree construction and conversion processes.

**Code Description**:
The `unaryBoxConstructor` function takes a string `attr` as input, which is used to identify specific attributes within the tree structures. It returns an inner class `Constructor`, which provides methods for constructing instances from a given tree structure (`from_tree`) and converting an instance back into a tree representation (`to_tree`). 

The `from_tree` method recursively constructs the object based on the provided tree, using the specified attribute to access subtrees. The `to_tree` method converts the current instance into a dictionary that can be used to reconstruct the tree structure.

This function is crucial for creating constructors and converters between custom objects (like `FA` and `BA`) and their corresponding tree representations in the context of categorial grammar, ensuring that these objects can be easily serialized and deserialized.

**Note**: 
- The `from_tree` method relies on a helper function `factory_name` to determine the class name dynamically. Ensure this function is defined elsewhere in your codebase.
- The `getattr(self, attr).to_tree()` call assumes that the attribute accessed by `attr` has a `to_tree` method implemented.

**Output Example**: 
For example, if you have an object constructed from a tree structure and then use `unaryBoxConstructor`, the output of `to_tree` might look like:
```python
{
    'factory': 'FA',
    'over': {
        'factory': 'Over',
        # ... other attributes ...
    }
}
```
This dictionary can be used to reconstruct the original object or stored for later use.
### ClassDef Constructor
**Constructor**: The function of Constructor is to create instances based on a given tree structure.
**attributes**: This class does not define any attributes explicitly; it relies on inheritance from its base class or methods provided by the base class.
**Code Description**: 
The `Constructor` class in the `categorial.py` file provides functionality for constructing objects using a tree-like structure. It includes two key methods: `from_tree` and `to_tree`.

- The `from_tree` method is a class method that takes another instance of `tree` as an argument and returns a new instance of the current class (`cls`). This method recursively constructs instances based on the attributes of the input tree.
  
  ```python
  @classmethod
  def from_tree(cls, tree):
      return cls(from_tree(tree[attr]))
  ```
  - It uses recursion to traverse the tree structure. For each attribute in the `tree`, it calls itself with that attribute as a new argument, effectively building up the object's attributes step by step.

- The `to_tree` method returns a dictionary representation of the current instance. This dictionary includes information about the factory function (determined by `factory_name`) and recursively converts all contained objects to their tree representations.
  
  ```python
  def to_tree(self):
      return {
          'factory': factory_name(type(self)),
          attr: getattr(self, attr).to_tree()
      }
  ```
  - The method uses the `getattr` function to retrieve attributes from the current instance and calls `to_tree` on those attributes if they are instances that can be represented in a tree structure.
  
  - `factory_name(type(self))` is used to get the name of the factory function responsible for creating this type of object, which helps in reconstructing the object later.

**Note**: Ensure that all child objects within the instance also have their own `from_tree` and `to_tree` methods properly defined to support recursive construction and representation. Pay attention to how attributes are handled to avoid infinite recursion or missing data.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of a derived class from `Constructor` is created using the following tree structure:
```python
tree = {
    'factory': 'some_factory',
    'attribute1': 'value1',
    'attribute2': {
        'factory': 'child_factory',
        'child_attribute': 'child_value'
    }
}
```
The output of `to_tree` might look like this:
```python
{
    'factory': 'some_factory',
    'attribute1': 'value1',
    'attribute2': {
        'factory': 'child_factory',
        'child_attribute': 'child_value'
    }
}
```
#### FunctionDef from_tree(cls, tree)
**from_tree**: The function of `from_tree` is to construct an instance of the current class from a tree structure.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `tree`, which should be a tree-like structure (e.g., a dictionary or another object that can represent a tree).

**Code Description**: 
The `from_tree` method takes a single argument, `tree`, and recursively constructs an instance of the current class based on the provided tree structure. The function works by:
1. Recursively calling itself with each attribute of the input `tree`. This means if `tree` is a dictionary or another object that can be accessed via keys (like 'attr'), it will call `from_tree(tree[attr])`.
2. Each recursive call returns an instance of the current class, which gets combined to form the final structure.
3. The method ultimately returns the constructed instance of the current class.

This approach is commonly used in tree or graph traversal scenarios where a complex nested data structure needs to be converted into a structured object hierarchy.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `tree` argument follows the expected format, as incorrect input can lead to errors.
- The method assumes that the attributes referenced by the keys (like 'attr') are valid and exist in the provided tree. If any attribute is missing or invalid, it may result in an error.

**Output Example**: 
If the input `tree` is a dictionary like `{ "attr": {"sub_attr": 1} }`, the method will recursively construct instances of the current class based on this structure, potentially resulting in a nested object hierarchy. For instance:
```python
# Assuming UnaryBoxConstructor is a subclass of Constructor
instance = UnaryBoxConstructor.from_tree({"attr": {"sub_attr": 1}})
```
The `instance` would be an instance constructed from the provided tree structure, with attributes and substructures as defined by the recursive calls to `from_tree`.
***
#### FunctionDef to_tree(self)
**to_tree**: The function of `to_tree` is to convert the current unary box constructor instance into a tree representation.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `to_tree` method converts the current instance of `unaryBoxConstructor` (which is likely part of a category theory or diagrammatic reasoning framework) into a tree structure. The returned dictionary contains two main keys:
- `'factory'`: A string representing the factory name for the class, generated using the `factory_name` function from the `utils.py` module.
- Each other key corresponds to an attribute of the current instance, with its value being the result of calling `to_tree()` on that attribute if it is another `unaryBoxConstructor` or a similar object.

Here’s a detailed analysis:
1. **Factory Name**: The `'factory'` key holds a string representing the full path of the class name, which helps in reconstructing the exact type and structure later.
2. **Attributes Conversion**: For each attribute (other than `factory`), its value is recursively converted into a tree representation through the same `to_tree` method. This ensures that all nested structures are properly serialized.

This function plays a crucial role in serializing complex diagrammatic or categorical objects for storage, transmission, or further processing. It leverages the `factory_name` function to ensure accurate reconstruction of class types and uses recursion to handle nested structures.

**Note**: Ensure that the `to_tree` method is called on instances that can be represented as a tree structure (i.e., they have attributes that can also be converted into trees). This includes all relevant subclasses or components of the `unaryBoxConstructor`.

**Output Example**: 
Given an instance of `FA(x << y)`, where `x` and `y` are types (`Ty` objects), the output might look like:
```python
{
    'factory': 'grammar.box.FA',
    'input': {
        'factory': 'grammar.pregroup.Ty',
        'name': 'x'
    },
    'output': {
        'factory': 'grammar.pregroup.Ty',
        'name': 'y'
    }
}
```
This output represents the structure of the `FA` box with its input and output types converted into a dictionary format suitable for serialization.

### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the FA object.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method in this code provides a textual representation of an instance of the `FA` class. Specifically, it returns a string that starts with "FA(" and includes a representation of the first element of the domain (`self.dom[:1]`) enclosed within parentheses. This is achieved using Python's `repr()` function, which generates a string containing a printable representation of an object.
- The method accesses the `dom` attribute of the current instance, which presumably contains information about the domain of the FA (Finite Automaton) being represented.
- It then uses slicing (`self.dom[:1]`) to get the first element of this domain. This could be useful for debugging or logging purposes where only the initial part of the domain is relevant.
- The `repr()` function is called on this sliced slice, ensuring that the representation returned by `__repr__` is also a valid Python expression that can recreate the object if needed.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `dom` attribute exists and contains the necessary information. If `dom` is empty or not properly initialized, the method will return an incomplete string.
- The use of `repr()` for both the FA instance and its domain ensures that the output is consistent with how Python would represent these objects in a console.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.dom` contains `[0, 1, 2]`, then calling `__repr__` on an instance of `FA` would return `"FA([0])"`.

### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the BA object.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method is defined to provide a string that can be used to recreate the object. In this case, it returns a formatted string representing the `BA` object with its domain (`dom`) part. The representation uses an f-string to include the result of calling `repr()` on the slice of `self.dom` starting from the second element (i.e., `self.dom[1:]`). This approach ensures that the internal structure of the `BA` object is reflected in a readable and reconstructible format.

The use of `repr(self.dom[1:])` within the f-string allows for a detailed view of the domain part of the `BA` object, excluding its first element. The `repr()` function itself returns a string that would allow for the exact reconstruction of the object if provided as input to the constructor or initializer method.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `dom` attribute is correctly defined and contains the necessary information.
- This representation assumes that the `dom` attribute is an iterable, such as a list or tuple, which can be sliced and passed to `repr()`.

**Output Example**: If `self.dom` is `[A, B, C]`, then the output of `__repr__` would be `"BA(B,C)"`. This string could be used to recreate the object by passing it back into the constructor or an equivalent method.

## FunctionDef cat2ty(string)
**cat2ty**: The function of `cat2ty` is to translate the string representation of a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) category into DisCoPy's type system.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `string : str` - A string with slashes representing a CCG category.

**Code Description**:
The function `cat2ty` translates a string representing a CCG category into its corresponding type in the DisCoPy framework. It handles different types of categories by recursively breaking down the input string and constructing the appropriate type using DisCoPy's combinators (`>>`, `<<`). The translation process involves several helper functions:

1. **unbracket**: This function removes the outermost brackets from a string, returning the inner content if present.
2. **remove_modifier**: It uses regular expressions to remove any modifiers (represented by square brackets) within the input string.
3. **split**: This function splits the input string into left and right parts based on the presence of backslashes (`\`) or slashes (`/`), which are used as category combinators in CCG.

The main logic of `cat2ty` involves:
- Splitting the input string using the helper function `split`.
- Recursively translating the left and right parts of the split string.
- Constructing a DisCoPy type based on whether the slash is a backslash (`\`) or a forward slash (`/`). A backslash indicates a composition in one direction, while a forward slash indicates the opposite.

The function ensures that the input string is correctly parsed into its corresponding DisCoPy type, allowing for further manipulation within the DisCoPy framework.

**Note**: The `cat2ty` function assumes that the input strings are well-formed CCG categories. Improperly formatted strings may lead to incorrect translations or errors.

**Output Example**: For an input string like "(/NP/VP)", the output would be a type in DisCoPy representing the composition of NP (Noun Phrase) and VP (Verb Phrase), where NP is on the left and VP is on the right. This could translate to `cat2ty("/NP/VP")` returning `NP >> VP`.
### FunctionDef unbracket(string)
**unbracket**: The function of unbracket is to remove the outermost parentheses from a string if they exist.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: string (str) - A string that potentially contains outermost parentheses.

**Code Description**: The `unbracket` function checks whether the input string starts with an opening parenthesis `'('`. If it does, the function returns the substring excluding the first and last characters of the string. This effectively removes any outermost parentheses from the input string if they exist. If the string does not start with an opening parenthesis, the function simply returns the original string unchanged.

The `unbracket` function is called by the `split` function, which processes strings containing categorial grammatical categories represented in a bracketed form. The `split` function uses `unbracket` to strip away outer parentheses before attempting to split the string on certain characters (like `'\\'` or `'/'`). This ensures that any nested structures within the input string are correctly handled, and only the top-level structure is processed.

In the context of categorial grammatical categories, this function helps in isolating individual components from a larger expression by removing unnecessary outer parentheses. For instance, if you have a string like `"(NP/DT)"`, calling `unbracket` on it would return `"NP/DT"`.

**Note**: Ensure that the input string is properly formatted and does not contain mismatched or nested parentheses beyond the top level, as this function only removes the outermost pair of parentheses. If there are multiple levels of nesting, you may need to use a more sophisticated parsing approach.

**Output Example**: 
- Input: `"NP/DT"`
- Output: `"NP/DT"`

- Input: `"(NP/DT)"`
- Output: `"NP/DT"`
***
### FunctionDef remove_modifier(string)
**remove_modifier**: The function of remove_modifier is to strip out any bracketed modifiers from a given string.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: string (The input string from which bracketed modifiers are to be removed.)

**Code Description**: The `remove_modifier` function uses a regular expression to identify and remove any substring that is enclosed within square brackets. This process involves the following steps:

1. **Regular Expression Matching**: A regular expression pattern, `r'\[[^\]]*\]'`, is used to match any sequence of characters enclosed in square brackets. Here, `[^\]]*` matches any character except a closing bracket (`]`) zero or more times.
2. **Substitution Operation**: The `re.sub()` function replaces all occurrences of the matched pattern with an empty string, effectively removing them from the input string.

This function is designed to clean up strings by eliminating any bracketed content that might be considered modifiers in certain grammatical contexts. It is often used as a preprocessing step before further analysis or processing of categorical grammar strings.

**Note**: The caller `split` uses this function to handle cases where square brackets are present and need to be removed, ensuring that the string can be split correctly based on other delimiters like backslashes (`\`) or slashes (`/`). However, if no such delimiter is found, it falls back to calling `remove_modifier`.

**Output Example**: If the input string is `"This [is] a (test) example"`, the output of `remove_modifier` will be `"This  a  example"`.
***
### FunctionDef split(string)
**split**: The function of split is to parse strings representing categorial grammatical categories by identifying specific delimiters within the string.
· parameter1: string (str) - A string that represents a categorial grammatical category, potentially containing nested structures and various delimiters.

**Code Description**: The `split` function processes input strings that are formatted as categorial grammatical categories. It aims to identify and separate these categories based on specific delimiters such as backslashes (`\`) or slashes (`/`). Here is a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: A variable `par_count` is initialized to zero. This counter will help track the level of nested parentheses in the string.
2. **Character Iteration**: The function iterates over each character in the input string using `enumerate`. For each character, it performs different actions based on its type:
   - If the character is an opening parenthesis `'('`, the `par_count` is incremented to indicate a deeper nesting level.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis `')'`, the `par_count` is decremented to reflect a return to a less nested structure.
   - For characters that are either backslashes (`\`) or slashes (`/`), and if they occur at a top-level (i.e., when `par_count` is zero), the function splits the string into three parts:
     - The substring before the delimiter, obtained using `string[:i]`.
     - The delimiter itself.
     - The substring after the delimiter, obtained using `string[i + 1:]`.

3. **Return Values**: If a valid split point is found (i.e., a top-level backslash or slash), the function returns three values:
   - The part of the string before the delimiter.
   - The delimiter character itself.
   - The part of the string after the delimiter.

4. **Fallback Handling**: If no valid split points are found, the function falls back to calling `remove_modifier` on the entire input string and returns the result along with `None` values for the other two return parameters.

The relationship between `split` and its callees in the project is as follows: 
- The `unbracket` function is used within `split` to remove any outermost parentheses from the input string. This ensures that only the top-level structure of the categorial category is processed.
- If no valid split points are found, `remove_modifier` is called on the entire string to clean up any bracketed modifiers before returning.

**Note**: Ensure that the input string is properly formatted and does not contain mismatched or nested parentheses beyond the top level. The function only removes the outermost pair of parentheses, so for multiple levels of nesting, a more sophisticated parsing approach may be necessary.
**Output Example**: 
- Input: `"NP\VP"`
- Output: `("NP", "\\", "VP")`

- Input: `"NP/(DT/NP)"`
- Output: `("NP", "/", "(DT/NP)")`

- Input: `"(NP/DT)"`
- Output: `("NP/DT", None, None)`
