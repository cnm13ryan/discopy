## FunctionDef from_spacy(doc)
**from_spacy**: The function of `from_spacy` is to interface with SpaCy's dependency parser and return a `cfg.Tree`.

**Parameters**:
· doc: Spacy Doc object

**Code Description**: 
The `from_spacy` function serves as an intermediary between the SpaCy library, which processes natural language text, and the `cfg.Tree` data structure used in the `cfg` package. It takes a `Spacy Doc` object as input, which contains parsed information about each token (word) in a sentence, including their dependencies.

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the root node (`root`) has any children. If not, it returns a simple `Word` object with the text and dependency tag of the root.
2. **Dependency Tensor Construction**: If there are children, it constructs a tensor representation for the dependencies of the root's children using their respective dependency tags.
3. **Rule Application**: A rule is then applied to create a `Rule` object that encapsulates the relationship between the root's dependency and its children’s dependencies.
4. **Recursive Tree Construction**: The function recursively calls itself on each child, building up the tree structure from the bottom.

The `from_spacy` function leverages the hierarchical nature of SpaCy's parsed data to construct a structured representation that can be used for further linguistic analysis or manipulation.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input is a valid `Spacy Doc` object. This means the text has been correctly processed by SpaCy.
- The `cfg.Tree` structure provides a way to represent and manipulate syntactic structures in a hierarchical manner, which can be useful for tasks such as parsing or generating sentences.

**Output Example**: 
Given an input sentence "The cat sat on the mat", the output could be a tree representation like:
```
Rule(Ty('ROOT'), Ty('nsubj'), name='cat')
  Word(text='The', dep_='det')
  Word(text='cat', dep_='nsubj')
Rule(Ty('on'), Ty('prep'), name='sat')
  Word(text='the', dep_='det')
  Word(text='mat', dep_='pobj')
```
This example shows how the function constructs a tree where each node represents a word and its dependencies, forming a structured representation of the sentence's syntactic structure.
## FunctionDef find_root(doc)
**find_root**: The function of find_root is to identify the root node (or the main verb) in a SpaCy document.
**Parameters**:
· doc: Spacy Doc object

**Code Description**: 
The `find_root` function iterates through each token in the provided SpaCy document (`doc`). It checks if the dependency label (`dep_`) of the current token is 'ROOT', which indicates that this token is the root node or main verb of the sentence. If a token with the 'ROOT' dependency label is found, it immediately returns this token.

This function plays a crucial role in identifying the primary subject-verb relationship within a sentence for further processing in natural language understanding tasks. By finding the root node, subsequent operations can be more accurately targeted and focused on the main verb of the sentence.

**Note**: 
· Ensure that the input `doc` is a valid SpaCy Doc object.
· The function assumes that there is exactly one token with the 'ROOT' dependency label in the document; if no such token exists or multiple tokens have this label, the behavior is undefined.

**Output Example**: If the input document contains "The cat sat on the mat", and "sat" is tagged as the root node by SpaCy, `find_root` will return the token corresponding to "sat".
