## ClassDef Ty
**Ty**: The function of Ty is to represent pregroup types as rigid types.
**Attributes**:
· inside: The objects inside the type.

**Code Description**: 
The class `Ty` represents pregroup types within the DisCoPy framework, inheriting from the `rigid.Ty` base class. A pregroup type in this context can be thought of as a structured object that carries information about its internal composition and relationships with other types. The primary purpose of `Ty` is to ensure that these types adhere to certain rigid constraints, which are essential for maintaining consistency across various operations within the grammar and category theory framework.

The `inside` attribute holds the components or sub-types that make up the type itself. This allows for a hierarchical representation where a type can be decomposed into simpler parts, facilitating complex grammatical structures and transformations.

The class provides methods to support these rigid constraints, ensuring that operations such as tensor products, cups (cones), and other category-theoretic constructs are performed correctly according to the rules of pregroup theory. The relationship with its callers is evident in how `Ty` serves as a foundational type for constructing more complex grammatical structures.

For instance, `Ty` is used alongside other classes like `Word`, `Diagram`, and `Category` to build up sentences and parse them using functions such as `eager_parse` and `brute_force`. These functions leverage the rigid constraints defined by `Ty` to ensure that only valid grammatical combinations are considered.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all operations involving `Ty` respect its rigidity, meaning that any transformation or combination must maintain the structural integrity of the type.
- When using `Ty`, always consider whether it is appropriate for the specific context. Inappropriate use may lead to invalid grammatical structures and incorrect parsing results.
### FunctionDef assert_isadjoint(self, other)
**assert_isadjoint**: The function of assert_isadjoint is to check if two pregroup types are adjoints.
**Parameters**:
· other: The alleged right adjoint.

**Code Description**: 
The `assert_isadjoint` method checks whether the current type (`self`) and another given type (`other`) form an adjoint pair in a pregroup. If they do not, it raises an `AxiomError`.

Here's a detailed analysis of the code:

1. **Condition Check**:
   ```python
   if self.r != other and self != other.r:
   ```
   This condition checks whether the right component (`r`) of the current type is not equal to the given type (`other`), AND the current type itself is not the right component of `other`. If both conditions are true, it means that the two types do not form an adjoint pair.

2. **Exception Handling**:
   ```python
   raise AxiomError(messages.NOT_ADJOINT.format(self, other))
   ```
   When the condition in the if-statement is met (i.e., the types are not adjoints), it raises an `AxiomError` with a message that includes details about the current type and the given type. The `messages.NOT_ADJOINT` string is formatted to include these values, providing clear feedback on which types do not form an adjoint pair.

3. **Functional Relationship**:
   This method is likely used internally within the pregroup framework to ensure consistency in operations that depend on the adjoint relationship between types. For example, it could be part of a validation step before performing certain categorical operations or transformations.

4. **Error Handling**:
   The `assert_isadjoint` method serves as a form of static analysis by validating assumptions about type relationships at runtime. This helps prevent errors in downstream computations that rely on the adjoint property being true.

5. **Usage Context**:
   Given that this method is part of a pregroup implementation, it is expected to be called during operations where the adjoint relationship between types needs to be verified. For instance, when constructing morphisms or performing diagrammatic calculations in category theory.

**Note**: Ensure that `other` is indeed an instance of the same type as `self`, and that the right components (`r`) are correctly defined for both types. Any mismatch could lead to incorrect error messages or unexpected behavior.

### FunctionDef fa(cls, left, right)
**fa**: The function of fa is to create a new Diagram by applying a cup operation between a left element and a right element.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `left` - An instance of a class that can be combined with another object using the tensor product (`@`) operator. This element represents one side of the diagram.
· parameter2: `right` - An instance of a class containing elements and operations, specifically used to create a cup operation in the Diagram. The right element has two components: `l`, which is likely a label or identifier, and `right.l`, representing the left component for the cup operation.

**Code Description**: 
The function fa combines a given `left` element with a `right` element using tensor product (`@`). It specifically uses the `cups` method of the Diagram class to create a connection between the two elements. The `right` parameter is expected to be an instance that contains both a left and right component, where `right.l` refers to the left component used in the cup operation.

The diagram created by this function represents a basic transformation or interaction between the `left` and `right` elements. The `cups` method likely connects the bottom of the `right` element (denoted by `right.l`) with the top of the `left` element, forming a structure that could be part of a larger diagram in categorical grammar.

**Note**: Ensure that both `left` and `right` parameters are valid instances as required. The `right` parameter should have a `.l` attribute to support the cup operation. Misalignment or missing attributes can lead to errors.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming 'left' is an instance of some class and 'right' has a '.l' attribute
result = Diagram.fa(left, right)
```
The return value `result` would be a new Diagram object that visually represents the tensor product of `left` with a cup operation involving `right.l`. This could be depicted as a diagram where `left` is connected to `right.l`, forming a structured interaction between the two elements.
***
### FunctionDef ba(cls, left, right)
**ba**: The function of `ba` is to create a diagram representing a specific type of morphism in pregroup grammar theory.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: left - This represents a Diagram object on which the operation will be performed.
· parameter2: right - This also represents a Diagram object that will be combined with the result of operating on `left`.

**Code Description**: The function `ba` is designed to construct a composite diagram by combining two Diagram objects, `left` and `right`, using a specific morphism defined in pregroup theory. Specifically, it performs an operation that involves applying a cup (`cls.cups(left, left.r)`) on the `left` Diagram object, followed by a composition with the `right` Diagram object.

Here's a detailed breakdown:
1. **Cup Operation**: The function first applies a cup operation to the `left` Diagram and its reverse (`left.r`). In pregroup theory, cups represent binary operations that can combine elements in pairs.
2. **Composition**: After applying the cup operation, the result is then composed with the `right` Diagram object using the `@` operator. This composition signifies a sequential application of transformations represented by these diagrams.

**Note**: Ensure that both `left` and `right` are valid instances of the Diagram class before calling this function to avoid runtime errors.
**Output Example**: If `left` is a Diagram representing a certain morphism, and `right` represents another morphism, then `ba(left, right)` would return a new Diagram object that combines these two operations according to the rules defined in pregroup theory. For instance, if `left` is a morphism that pairs elements and `right` is a transformation that processes those paired elements further, the resulting Diagram from `ba(left, right)` would represent this combined operation.
***
### FunctionDef fc(cls, left, middle, right)
**fc**: The function of fc is to construct a diagram by composing three parts: left, middle, and right.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: left - An instance of Diagram representing the left part of the constructed diagram.
· parameter2: middle - An instance of Diagram representing the middle part that will be cupped with its l component.
· parameter3: right - An instance of Diagram representing the right part of the constructed diagram.

**Code Description**: The `fc` function is designed to create a more complex diagram by combining three simpler diagrams. Here's a detailed breakdown:
- **left @ cls.cups(middle.l, middle)**: This part of the code first applies the `cups` method on the left and right components of the `middle` Diagram instance. The `cups` method likely creates a cup (a specific type of morphism) between these two components, effectively connecting them in a way that allows for the composition of diagrams.
- **@ right.l**: After creating the connection with the `middle`, it then composes this result with the left component of the `right` Diagram instance. The `@` operator is commonly used to denote diagrammatic composition in category theory and related fields, where one morphism (or diagram) follows another.

Overall, the function `fc` takes three diagrams as input and returns a new diagram that combines them through a specific pattern involving cups, which are essential for creating complex structures from simpler ones in diagrammatic reasoning.

**Note**: Ensure that all inputs (`left`, `middle`, `right`) are properly instantiated Diagram objects. Also, verify that the components of the middle Diagram are correctly accessible (e.g., `.l` and `.r`).

**Output Example**: Suppose you have three diagrams: `left`, `middle`, and `right`. The output would be a new diagram where:
- The left part is connected to one side of the cup created by the `cups` method.
- The other side of this cup is connected to the right component of the middle diagram.
- Finally, the result is composed with the remaining left component of the right diagram.

For example, if `left`, `middle`, and `right` are instances of Diagram representing different parts of a computation or logical flow, then `fc(left, middle, right)` would return a new Diagram that represents their combined structure.
***
### FunctionDef bc(cls, left, middle, right)
**bc**: The function of bc is to compose diagrams by applying cups at specific points.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: left - This represents the left part of the diagram, which can be any Diagram instance or an instance that supports the `@` operator with another Diagram.
· parameter2: middle - This represents the middle part of the diagram, typically a Pregroup object or any other object that supports the `cups` method to create cups at specific points.
· parameter3: right - This represents the right part of the diagram, which can be any Diagram instance or an instance that supports the `@` operator with another Diagram.

**Code Description**: The function `bc` is designed to compose diagrams by applying a series of operations. Specifically, it takes three parameters and returns a new Diagram object constructed by composing these parts in a specific order.
1. **left.r @ cls.cups(middle, middle.r)**: This part of the code first applies the `r` method on the left parameter, which likely represents some transformation or preparation step for the left diagram. Then, it composes this result with a set of cups created by calling the `cups` method on the middle parameter. The `cups` method is expected to create a Pregroup object representing cups at specific points in the middle part of the diagram.
2. **@ right**: Finally, the resulting Diagram from the previous step is composed with the right parameter using the `@` operator, which likely represents some form of sequential composition or gluing of diagrams.

**Note**: Ensure that all parameters are compatible and support the required operations (`r`, `@`, `cups`). The `cups` method should correctly create cups at the specified points in the middle part of the diagram. Also, verify that the Diagram instances and their methods (like `r`) are implemented as expected.

**Output Example**: Suppose you have three Diagram objects representing different parts of a computation: `left`, `middle`, and `right`. The output would be a new Diagram object where:
- The left part is transformed.
- Cups are applied at specific points in the middle part.
- The right part is attached to the composed result.

For example, if you have:
```python
left = Diagram(...)
middle = Pregroup(...)
right = Diagram(...)
result = bc(left, middle, right)
```
The `result` would be a new Diagram that represents the composition of these parts with cups applied in the middle.
***
### FunctionDef fx(cls, left, middle, right)
**fx**: The function of fx is to construct a diagram using pregroup operations.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: left - An instance of Diagram representing one part of the input.
· parameter2: middle - An instance of Diagram representing the intermediate transformation.
· parameter3: right - An instance of Diagram representing another part of the input.

**Code Description**: 
The function `fx` is designed to create a complex diagram by combining simpler diagrams. It takes three parameters: `left`, `middle`, and `right`. The function performs operations on these diagrams using pregroup combinators such as `@` (tensor product), `>>` (composition of morphisms), `cls.swap()`, and `cls.cups()`.

1. **Tensor Product (`@`)**: This operator is used to combine the diagrams sequentially, ensuring that the structure of the diagram remains coherent.
2. **Composition (`>>`)**: The composition operator `>>` is applied to connect the output of one operation as the input of another, effectively chaining transformations.
3. **Swap Operation (`cls.swap()`)**: This function swaps the positions of two parts within a Diagram. Specifically, it performs a swap between `middle.l` and `right.r`, which could be useful for reorganizing the structure of the diagram.
4. **Cups Operation (`cls.cups()`)**: The `cups` operation is used to create cups at specific points in the diagram, effectively merging two lines or paths into one.

The overall process involves:
- Combining `left` and a swap operation on `middle.l` and `right.r`.
- Applying the intermediate transformation represented by `middle`.
- Swapping `left` with `right.r`.
- Finally, applying cups to merge the transformed parts.

This function is crucial for building complex diagrams from simpler components in the context of pregroup grammars.

**Note**: Ensure that all input Diagram instances are valid and compatible for the operations used. The structure of the resulting diagram depends heavily on the initial state of `left`, `middle`, and `right`.

**Output Example**: 
If `left` is a simple line, `middle` represents a transformation like swapping or merging lines, and `right` is another line, the output might be a more complex diagram where:
1. The left line is combined with a swap operation.
2. A middle transformation occurs.
3. The right line is repositioned and merged with the rest of the structure using cups.

For instance, if `left`, `middle`, and `right` are instances representing different grammatical structures in a language model, the output would be a more complex diagram representing their interaction according to pregroup rules.
***
### FunctionDef bx(cls, left, middle, right)
**bx**: The function of bx is to construct a Diagram by applying specific operations on input Diagrams.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: left - A Diagram representing the left part of the structure.
· parameter2: middle - A Diagram that serves as the core element in the construction process.
· parameter3: right - A Diagram representing the right part of the structure.

**Code Description**: The function `bx` constructs a new Diagram by performing a series of operations on the input Diagrams. Specifically, it first applies the swap operation between the left and middle parts, then concatenates this with the right part. After that, it performs cup operations to connect the middle part with its right component, followed by another swap operation involving the left and right parts.

1. **Step 1: Swap Operation** - `cls.swap(left.l, middle.r)`: This step swaps the left component of `left` with the right component of `middle`.
2. **Step 2: Concatenation** - `@ cls.swap(left.l, middle.r) @ right`: The result from Step 1 is concatenated with `right`, forming a new Diagram.
3. **Step 3: Cup Operation** - `cls.cups(middle, middle.r)`: This step creates a cup connection between the middle part and its right component.
4. **Step 4: Final Concatenation** - `@ cls.cups(middle, middle.r) @ cls.swap(left.l, right)`: The result from Step 3 is concatenated with another swap operation involving the left and right parts.

The overall effect of these operations is to create a complex Diagram structure that combines elements from `left`, `middle`, and `right` in a specific way defined by the operations performed.

**Note**: Ensure that all input Diagrams (`left`, `middle`, and `right`) are compatible with the operations being applied. Specifically, check that the components involved in swaps and cups can be properly connected.

**Output Example**: The function `bx` will return a new Diagram object that represents the combined structure described above. For example, if `left` is a simple Diagram with a single input, `middle` is another Diagram representing an operation, and `right` is yet another Diagram with a single output, the resulting Diagram from `bx` would be a complex structure where the operations are sequentially applied as per the defined steps.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return a new Swap object with its left or right components rotated.
**parameters**: This Function has two parameters.
· parameter1: left (bool) - A boolean value indicating whether to perform the rotation on the left component. If `left` is True, the left component will be rotated; otherwise, the right component will be rotated.
· parameter2: self (Swap object) - The current Swap object that needs to be rotated.

**Code Description**: 
The function `rotate` takes a boolean value `left` and an implicit `self` parameter. It returns a new instance of the `Swap` class with either its left or right components swapped based on the value of `left`. If `left` is set to True, it creates a new Swap object where the left component (denoted by `l`) is moved to the right position and the original right component (also denoted by `l`) becomes the new left component. Conversely, if `left` is False, it swaps the right components in the same manner.

The function uses conditional logic to determine which side of the Swap object should be modified:
- If `left` is True: It returns a new instance of `Swap` with the left component's l (denoted as self.left.l) and the original right component's l (self.right.l).
- If `left` is False: It returns a new instance of `Swap` with the left component's r (denoted as self.left.r) and the original right component's r (self.right.r).

This function effectively allows for the manipulation of Swap objects by rotating their internal components, which can be useful in various computational linguistics or diagrammatic reasoning tasks.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `Swap` class has attributes `left.l`, `left.r`, `right.l`, and `right.r` to support this operation.
- The function returns a new `Swap` object; it does not modify the original `self` object in place. 

**Output Example**: If there is an existing Swap object with components (l1, r2), calling `rotate(left=True)` would return a new Swap object with components (r2, l1). Conversely, `rotate(left=False)` would return a new Swap object with components (l1, r2) but with the roles of left and right swapped internally.
***
## ClassDef Spider
**Spider**: The function of Spider is to represent a pregroup spider within a diagrammatic structure.
**Attributes**: 
· `typ`: Represents the type of the spider, which can be either left or right.
· `phase`: Indicates the phase factor associated with the spider.

**Code Description**: The `Spider` class inherits from both `frobenius.Spider` and `Box`, integrating functionalities from these parent classes. This class is designed to model a pregroup spider within diagrammatic structures, specifically in the context of categorical quantum mechanics and related areas where such diagrams are used. 

The `rotate` method allows for the manipulation of the spider's structure by changing its orientation based on the specified parameter:
- If `left` is set to `False`, the method returns a new instance of `Spider` with the type set according to the right codomain (`self.typ.r`).
- Conversely, if `left` is `True`, it returns a new instance with the type set according to the left codomain (`self.typ.l`).

This method effectively supports transformations that are common in diagrammatic representations, such as those found in quantum computing and category theory. By providing this functionality, `Spider` enables developers to easily manipulate and visualize these complex structures.

**Note**: When using the `rotate` method, ensure that you correctly specify whether you want to rotate the spider based on its left or right type. Incorrect usage might lead to misinterpretation of the diagram's structure.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `Spider` with a codomain length of 3 and domain length of 2 is rotated to the right, the method will return a new `Spider` object where the `typ` attribute reflects the right type (e.g., `self.typ.r`) of the original spider. Conversely, rotating it to the left would set `typ` according to the left type (`self.typ.l`).
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to shift the typing information within the Spider structure based on a specified direction.

**parameters**:
· left: A boolean value indicating whether to perform a rotation on the left side (default is False).

**Code Description**: This method modifies the typing attribute of the Spider object by rotating it either to the left or right. Specifically, if `left` is set to `False`, the method returns a new Spider with its type information updated to the left component (`self.typ.l`) of the current type. Conversely, if `left` is `True`, it updates the type information to the right component (`self.typ.r`). The rest of the attributes (length of codomain and domain, phase) remain unchanged.

This method plays a crucial role in manipulating Spider diagrams, particularly when dealing with transformations that require reorienting the typing components. For instance, it can be used in scenarios where the directionality of operations needs to be adjusted without altering other properties like the phase or dimensions of the spider.

The `rotate` function is closely related to the `phase` method mentioned earlier. The `phase` method provides a way to inspect and possibly modify the phase value within the Spider object, while `rotate` focuses on shifting the typing information. Together, these methods enable more complex transformations and manipulations of Spider diagrams, which are essential in representing various quantum operations and diagrammatic calculations.

**Note**: Ensure that any changes made through `rotate` are reflected correctly in other parts of the codebase to maintain consistency. For example, if a phase is set or modified using `rotate`, it should be properly accounted for when generating string representations or computing adjoint operations via methods like `dagger`.

**Output Example**: If the current Spider has types `(A, B)` and you call `rotate(left=False)`, assuming `self.typ.l` is `B` and `self.typ.r` is `A`, the new Spider will have types `(B, A)`. The length of codomain and domain as well as the phase remain unchanged.

### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Word object that can be used to recreate the object or understand its structure.
**parameters**: There are no explicit parameters defined for this method, as it operates on the instance variables of the class itself.

**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method in the `Word` class is designed to generate a string representation of an instance. This string can be used to recreate the object or provide insight into its state. The method constructs the string by concatenating several parts, each representing different attributes of the Word object.

1. **Base Representation**: 
   ```python
   return f"Word({repr(self.name)}, {repr(self.cod)}{extra})"
   ```
   This line forms the core representation of the `Word` object, starting with "Word(" and ending with a closing parenthesis. It includes the name and codomain (`self.cod`) of the word.

2. **Domain Information**:
   ```python
   extra = f", dom={repr(self.dom)}" if self.dom else ""
   ```
   If the `dom` attribute (representing the domain) is not empty, it appends a string to `extra` that includes the domain information in the format `, dom=<domain representation>`.

3. **Dagger Information**:
   ```python
   extra += ", is_dagger=True" if self.is_dagger else ""
   ```
   If the `is_dagger` attribute (indicating whether the word is a dagger) is `True`, it appends ", is_dagger=True" to `extra`. This ensures that the representation includes this metadata.

4. **Zero Value Information**:
   ```python
   extra += f", z={self.z}" if self.z != 0 else ""
   ```
   If the `z` attribute (likely representing some numerical value) is not zero, it appends ", z=<value>" to `extra`. This provides additional context about any non-zero values associated with the word.

By combining these parts, the method constructs a comprehensive string representation that can be used for debugging or logging purposes. The use of `repr()` ensures that all attributes are represented in their most precise form, making it easier to understand and recreate the object's state.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all instance variables (`name`, `cod`, `dom`, `is_dagger`, `z`) are properly defined and initialized before calling this method.
- The string representation will be useful for debugging as it provides a clear view of the word's attributes.
- If any attribute is not present or is empty, it won't appear in the final string, maintaining clarity.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `Word` has the following attributes:
```python
name = "apple"
cod = [1]
dom = [2]
is_dagger = False
z = 5
```
The output of `__repr__` would be:
```
"Word('apple', [1], dom=[2])"
```

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of the application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures secure access control by implementing various authentication mechanisms and handling user sessions.

#### Key Features

- **User Login**: Allows registered users to log in using their credentials.
- **Session Management**: Manages active user sessions, ensuring that each session is unique and secure.
- **Password Reset**: Provides functionality for users to reset their passwords securely.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implements role-based access control to ensure that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles.

#### Authentication Mechanisms

1. **Username/Password Authentication**:
   - Users can log in by providing a valid username and password.
   - The service verifies the credentials against the user database.

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Enhances security by requiring users to provide an additional verification factor, such as a code sent via SMS or generated from an authenticator app.

3. **Social Login**:
   - Allows users to authenticate using their social media accounts, providing an alternative to traditional username/password authentication.

#### Session Management

- **Session Creation**: Upon successful login, the service creates a unique session token that is stored on the user's device and server.
- **Session Expiry**: Sessions are designed to expire after a period of inactivity to enhance security.
- **Logout**: The service supports explicit logout functionality, invalidating the current session.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Role Assignment**: Admins can assign roles to users through the application's administration panel.
- **Permission Mapping**: Each role is associated with specific permissions that determine what actions a user can perform within the application.
- **Dynamic Permissions**: The service dynamically checks user permissions at runtime, ensuring that only authorized actions are performed.

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login attempts.
- **Session Token Handling**: Tokens are securely managed, with proper handling of session timeouts and invalidation.

#### Dependencies

- **Dependencies**: The service relies on the `UserRepository` for user data management and the `TokenManager` for session token generation and validation.

#### Maintenance and Updates

Regular updates and maintenance ensure that the `UserAuthenticationService` remains secure and up-to-date with the latest security practices. Security patches and feature enhancements are applied as needed to address any vulnerabilities or improve functionality.

## ClassDef Functor
**Functor**: The function of Functor is to represent a pregroup functor as a Frobenius functor.
**Attributes**:
· dom: Represents the domain category of the Functor.
· cod: Represents the codomain category of the Functor.

**Code Description**: 
The `Functor` class in the `pregroup.py` file inherits from the `Frobenius.Functor` class. It is designed to model a pregroup functor, which is a specific type of Frobenius functor with a pregroup as its domain category. The constructor initializes both the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) categories using the `Category` class provided in the same file.

The domain and codomain categories are set to instances of the `Category` class, indicating that this Functor operates within a categorical framework where types (objects) and diagrams (morphisms) are rigid. This setup ensures that the Functor respects the structure defined by the pregroup category.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `Category` and `Frobenius.Functor` classes are correctly imported before using the `Functor` class.
- The domain and codomain categories should be properly configured to reflect the specific requirements of the pregroup functor being modeled.
