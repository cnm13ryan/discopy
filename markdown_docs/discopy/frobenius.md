## ClassDef Ob
**Ob**: The function of Ob is to represent self-dual pivotal objects within the Frobenius framework.
**attributes**: 
· name: The name of the object.

**Code Description**: The `Ob` class is defined as a subclass of `pivotal.Ob`, inheriting its properties and methods while adding specific functionality for representing self-dual pivotal objects in the context of Frobenius categories. A key characteristic of this class is that it defines two properties, `l` and `r`, which are set to be equal to the object itself (`self`). This suggests a symmetry or duality within the object's structure.

The `Ob` class has a single parameter:
· name: The name assigned to the object instance. While not explicitly used in the implementation of the properties, this attribute could potentially be utilized for identification or labeling purposes when working with multiple instances of `Ob`.

In the context of its caller, `Ty`, which is defined in `discopy/frobenius.py/Ty`, the `ob_factory` attribute is set to an instance of `Ob`. This indicates that `Ty` uses `Ob` as a factory for creating Frobenius objects. The relationship between `Ty` and `Ob` can be understood as follows: `Ty` provides a structured container (a type) where each element is an object created by the `Ob` class, thereby integrating self-dual pivotal behavior into its composition.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that you provide a meaningful name to the objects you instantiate. Although the properties `l` and `r` are set to be equal, understanding their implications in the context of Frobenius categories is crucial for leveraging the full potential of these objects within your designs or applications.

## ClassDef PRO
**PRO**: The function of PRO is to represent natural numbers as frobenius types with unnamed objects.
**attributes**: 
· n: The length of the PRO type.

**Code Description**: The `PRO` class inherits from both `rigid.PRO` and `Ty`, enabling it to leverage functionalities provided by these classes. This design choice suggests that `PRO` aims to integrate properties of frobenius types while maintaining some characteristics of rigid PROs, likely related to their categorical nature in the context of diagrammatic reasoning or quantum computing.

- **Inheritance**: The class explicitly mentions ambiguous inheritance from both `rigid.PRO` and `Ty`, indicating potential conflicts or overlapping methods that need careful management. This dual heritage might provide a richer set of operations but requires developers to be aware of any potential issues arising from these overlaps.
  
- **Properties**: 
  - `l = r = property(lambda self: self)`: This line defines properties `l` and `r`, both of which return the instance itself (`self`). In the context of categorical structures, this might represent identity morphisms or similar operations that are fundamental in defining frobenius types.

**Note**: When using the `PRO` class, developers should ensure they understand the implications of its inheritance from both `rigid.PRO` and `Ty`. Care must be taken to avoid conflicts or unintended behavior due to ambiguous methods. Additionally, the properties `l` and `r` might have specific significance in the broader context of categorical diagrams or quantum circuits, so their usage should align with these theoretical underpinnings.

## ClassDef Cup
**Cup**: The function of Cup is to represent a Frobenius cup in a diagrammatic category theory context.
**Attributes**:
· left (Ty): The atomic type on one side of the cup.
· right (Ty): The atomic type on the other side of the cup.

**Code Description**: The `Cup` class is designed to model a Frobenius cup, which plays an important role in diagrammatic category theory. It inherits from both `compact.Cup` and `Box`, indicating its dual nature as a compact morphism and a box (or a general morphism) within the context of Frobenius diagrams.

The `Cup` class is part of a larger framework that supports the construction and manipulation of diagrams in category theory. It is often used alongside other classes such as `Cap`, which represents the dual concept, to form basic building blocks for more complex diagrams. The inheritance from `compact.Cup` suggests that it adheres to certain properties or operations specific to compact morphisms.

In the context of its callers and callees in the project:
- It is referenced in tests related to Functors (e.g., `test_Functor_call`), where it appears as an input for Functor transformations. These tests verify how Functors handle basic diagrammatic elements like cups, ensuring that the transformation logic works correctly.
- The `Cup` class is also used within Functor definitions and operations, indicating its importance in defining and manipulating categorical structures.

**Note**: When using the `Cup` class, ensure that you instantiate it with appropriate atomic types (`Ty`). Additionally, be mindful of how it interacts with other diagrammatic elements like `Cap`, as they are often paired to form basic unitary transformations. Always check for any specific properties or operations defined in its parent classes, such as `compact.Cup`, to fully utilize the class's functionality.
## ClassDef Cap
**Cap**: The function of Cap is to represent a Frobenius cap in a diagram.
**Attributes**: This class has two parameters:
· left: Specifies the atomic type on one side of the cap.
· right: Specifies the adjoint atomic type, which is connected to the left type.

**Code Description**: 
The `Cap` class inherits from both `compact.Cap` and `Box`, indicating that it combines properties from these classes. The `__ambiguous_inheritance__` attribute suggests that there might be some ambiguity or conflict in how these two base classes are inherited, but the specific details of this ambiguity are not provided.

In terms of functionality, a `Cap` object is used to represent a Frobenius cap within a Frobenius diagram. This structure is fundamental in category theory and quantum information theory. The class likely includes methods for operations such as composition with other diagrams or transformations that are relevant to the Frobenius structure.

The `Cap` class is called in several test cases:
1. In `test_Functor_call`, it is used alongside other diagram elements like `Box` and `Spider`. Specifically, when tested with a `Functor` instance, it ensures that the transformation rules for caps are correctly applied.
2. In `test_cups`, although not directly called, its functionality is indirectly referenced as part of testing the relationship between cups and caps in hypergraph diagrams.

**Note**: When using the `Cap` class, ensure that you understand the Frobenius structure it represents to apply it correctly within your diagram constructions. Pay attention to how it interacts with other elements like `Box`, `Spider`, and transformations defined by functors.
## ClassDef Swap
**Swap**: The function of Swap is to represent a swap operation between two types within a Frobenius diagram.
**Attributes**:
· left (Ty): The type on the top left and bottom right of the swap.
· right (Ty): The type on the top right and bottom left of the swap.

**Code Description**: 
The `Swap` class is designed to model a swap operation in a Frobenius diagram, which essentially swaps two types while preserving the overall structure of the diagram. It inherits from the `Box` class, indicating that it represents a specific type of morphism within the category theory framework used by the library.

- **Initialization**: The `Swap` class is initialized with two parameters, `left` and `right`, which define the types being swapped.
- **Permutation Representation**: The `Swap` class contains a method to represent the swap operation as a permutation. In this case, it returns `Diagram.permutation([1, 0])`, which corresponds to swapping indices 0 and 1 in a list or array context.

**Reference Relationships**:
- **Called by Test Cases**: The `Swap` class is referenced by several test cases within the project, such as `test_Functor_swap` and `test_Functor_call`. These tests validate how the `Swap` operation interacts with other operations like composition (`@`) and functorial mappings.
  - In `test_Functor_swap`, it checks if swapping two boxes results in an equivalent diagram after applying a functor.
  - In `test_Functor_call`, it ensures that `Swap` behaves correctly under various transformations, including when combined with other morphisms like spiders (`Spider`) and cups/caps (`Cup`, `Cap`).

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the types passed to `left` and `right` are consistent throughout your operations.
- The `Swap` operation is fundamental for rearranging elements within a Frobenius diagram, making it crucial for maintaining the integrity of tensorial and categorical structures.

**Output Example**: When calling `frobenius.Swap(x, x)`, the output will be represented as `Diagram.permutation([1, 0])`, which indicates that the swap operation has been correctly applied to type `x`.
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return the current Swap instance without any modifications.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (bool) - This parameter is not used within the function and is explicitly deleted.

**Code Description**: 
The `rotate` method does not perform any actual rotation operation. Instead, it returns the calling object (`self`) unchanged. The `left` parameter is provided but is immediately deleted using the `del` statement, indicating that this parameter might have been intended for future use or was a placeholder during development.

```python
def rotate(self, left=False):
    del left  # This line deletes the 'left' parameter, as it is not used within the function.
    return self  # The method returns the current instance of Swap without making any changes.
```

**Note**: 
- Ensure that no external state or side effects are dependent on the `left` parameter being passed to this function. Since it is deleted, passing a value for `left` will have no effect.

**Output Example**: 
```python
swap_instance = Swap()
result = swap_instance.rotate(left=True)  # The 'left' parameter is ignored.
print(result)  # Output: <Swap object at 0x7f8b9c3d2e10>
```

In the example above, `swap_instance` is an instance of the `Swap` class. Calling `rotate` on this instance with any value for `left`, including `True`, will simply return the same instance without any modifications.

***
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a dictionary.
**parameters**:
· state: A dictionary containing the serialized state of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The `__setstate__` method is responsible for restoring the internal state of the `Spider` class instance when it is being unpickled (i.e., loaded back into memory after being saved). This method ensures that the object's attributes are correctly reconstructed based on the serialized data provided in the `state` dictionary.

1. **Check if "_name" exists and matches type(self).__name__**: The first condition checks whether the `"_"` prefix of a key (like `_name`) is present in the state dictionary and whether its value matches the class name of the current object. This step ensures that only valid instances of the same class can be restored.
2. **Retrieve phase data if available**: If the `"_data"` key exists in the state, it retrieves the associated phase data. The phase data is then formatted as a string and appended to the `_name` attribute if present.
3. **Extract domain (`_dom`) and codomain (`_cod`) from state**: It extracts the domain and codomain values stored under the keys `'_dom'` and `'_cod'` in the state dictionary, respectively. These values are used to represent the dimensions of the spider's legs.
4. **Construct `_name` attribute with updated information**: The method constructs a new string for the `_name` attribute by combining the class name, domain size (`n`), codomain size (`n`), and phase data (if any). This formatted string is then assigned back to the `_name` attribute of the object.
5. **Call superclass's __setstate__**: Finally, it calls the `__setstate__` method of the superclass using `super().__setstate__(state)`. This ensures that any additional state restoration logic defined in the base class is also executed.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the serialized state dictionary (`state`) contains all necessary keys (`'_name'`, `'_dom'`, `'_cod'`, and optionally `'_data'`). Any missing or incorrect key values may result in an invalid object state. Additionally, it's crucial to maintain consistency between the class name used during serialization and deserialization to prevent unexpected behavior.
***
### FunctionDef phase(self)
**phase**: The function of phase is to return the phase associated with the spider.
**parameters**: There are no parameters for this Function.
**Code Description**: This method returns the current phase value stored within the Spider object. If the phase is not set (i.e., `self.phase` is `None`), it will return `None`. Otherwise, it directly returns the stored phase value.

This function plays a crucial role in managing and retrieving the phase attribute of the spider, which is often used to represent certain quantum operations or transformations within the Spider diagram. The phase can be manipulated through various methods such as `rotate`, `dagger`, and others, but this method provides a straightforward way to inspect its current state.

In the context of the project, this function is called by several other methods like `__repr__` and `dagger`. For instance, in the `__repr__` method, it helps format the string representation of the spider object, including the phase information if available. Similarly, the `dagger` method uses the phase to compute the adjoint operation on a spider.

**Note**: Ensure that any changes made to the phase through methods like `rotate` or `dagger` are correctly reflected in this function for consistency and correct representation of the spider object.
**Output Example**: If the Spider instance has a phase set to 3, calling `phase()` will return `3`. If no phase is set, it returns `None`.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the Spider object.
· parameter1: None (This method does not take any parameters)
**Code Description**: The `__repr__` method generates a human-readable string that represents the current state of the Spider object. This string can be useful for debugging and logging purposes, as it provides a clear overview of the object's attributes and structure.

The method first constructs a base representation by concatenating the class name with an opening angle bracket (`<`). It then appends each attribute value in the format `key=value`, separated by commas. These values are obtained from the instance variables of the Spider class using the `vars()` function, which returns a dictionary containing all the attributes and their corresponding values.

Finally, it adds a closing angle bracket (`>`) to complete the string representation. This ensures that the output is consistent with Python's standard object representation format.

The `__repr__` method also includes information about the input and output gates of the Spider object by calling `input_gates()` and `output_gates()`, respectively. These methods return lists of gates, which are then converted to strings using a list comprehension. The resulting string is appended to the base representation to provide additional context.

**Note**: When you print an instance of the Spider class or use it in a context where its string representation is required (e.g., logging), the `__repr__` method will be called automatically, providing a detailed and structured output that helps in understanding the current state of the object.

**Output Example**: If the Spider object has input gates named "in1" and "in2", and output gates named "out1", the `__repr__` method might produce an output like this: `<Spider(in1, in2; out1)`.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to compute the adjoint operation on the spider.
**parameters**: There are no parameters for this Function.
**Code Description**: This method computes the adjoint (or dagger) of the current Spider instance. It does so by setting the phase attribute to its negative value if it is not `None`. The adjoint operation in quantum computing typically involves taking the complex conjugate transpose of a matrix, and here it is represented through the phase inversion.

The process within the method is straightforward:
1. If the phase (`self.phase`) is not `None`, it sets the new phase to `-self.phase`.
2. It then returns a new instance of the Spider class with the updated domain size (`len(self.cod)`), codomain size (`len(self.dom)`), type information (`self.typ`), and the newly computed phase.

This method plays a critical role in the manipulation of spiders, particularly when dealing with adjoint operations. The `dagger` function is often used to reverse or invert certain transformations represented by the spider diagram, ensuring that the overall structure maintains consistency under such operations.

**Note**: Ensure that any changes made through this method are consistent and correctly reflected in other parts of the codebase, especially in methods like `__repr__`, where phase information might be displayed. This helps maintain a coherent representation of the spider object throughout its lifecycle.

**Output Example**: If the Spider instance has a phase set to 3, calling `dagger()` will return a new Spider instance with a phase set to -3. If no phase is set (i.e., `self.phase` is `None`), it returns a new instance with the same phase value (`None`).
***
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to modify the spider diagram by rotating it, potentially affecting its phase attribute.
**parameters**: 
· left: A boolean value indicating whether to perform a left rotation (default is False).

**Code Description**: This method `rotate` returns a new instance of the current Spider object with modified properties. Specifically, it creates and returns an instance of the same type as the original spider but with different domain and codomain sizes based on the input parameters. The `del left` statement suggests that this parameter is included for consistency or future use, even though it is not utilized within the method.

The return value of `rotate` involves creating a new Spider object using the constructor `type(self)(len(self.cod), len(self.dom), self.typ, self.phase)`. Here:
- `self.cod` and `self.dom` represent the codomain and domain sizes of the original spider.
- `self.typ` likely refers to the type or kind of spider (e.g., a specific type of quantum operation).
- `self.phase` holds the phase associated with the spider, which is preserved in the new object.

This method plays a crucial role in manipulating Spider diagrams, particularly for operations that require reconfiguring the structure while maintaining certain attributes like the phase. The `rotate` function allows developers to create variations of spiders by adjusting their domain and codomain sizes without losing important properties such as the phase.

**Note**: Although the `left` parameter is not used within this method, it should be consistent with other methods in the Spider class that might utilize it for more complex operations. Ensure that any changes made through `rotate` are correctly reflected in the phase to maintain consistency and accurate representation of the spider object.

**Output Example**: If the original spider has a codomain size of 3, domain size of 2, type "quantum", and phase set to π/4, calling `rotate(left=False)` will return a new Spider instance with a codomain size of 3, domain size of 2, type "quantum", and the same phase value π/4. If no phase is set, it returns `None` for the phase in both the original and new instances.

## ClassDef Bubble
**Bubble**: The function of Bubble is to represent a Frobenius bubble within a frobenius diagram.
**Attributes**: This class inherits from `monoidal.Bubble` and `Box`, indicating it combines properties of both these classes.
· name: Inherits the name attribute, representing the identifier or label for the bubble.
· dom: Inherits the domain attribute, which specifies the input type or shape of the bubble.
· cod: Inherits the codomain attribute, defining the output type or shape of the bubble.

**Code Description**: The `Bubble` class serves as a fundamental building block in frobenius diagrams. It inherits from both `monoidal.Bubble` and `Box`, integrating their functionalities to represent a specific element within these diagrams. Frobenius bubbles are essential components that help define the structure and behavior of operations in categorical algebra, particularly in the context of Frobenius algebras.

Inheriting from `monoidal.Bubble` ensures that this class adheres to the monoidal category rules, which are crucial for defining how objects can be combined or decomposed. On the other hand, inheriting from `Box` provides additional structure and behavior, such as handling input-output relationships in a diagrammatic way.

The `__ambiguous_inheritance__` attribute is set to `(monoidal.Bubble,)`, indicating that there might be some ambiguity regarding inheritance, possibly due to overlapping methods or attributes. This could suggest the need for careful method overriding or redefinition to avoid conflicts between the inherited classes.

### FunctionDef method(n_legs_in, n_legs_out, typ, phases)
**method**: The function of method is to construct an interleaving diagram by tensoring swap operations based on given input parameters.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: n_legs_in - An integer representing the number of legs (inputs) that each type in `typ` has at the beginning.
· parameter2: n_legs_out - An integer representing the number of legs (outputs) that each type in `typ` should have at the end.
· parameter3: typ - A list or iterable containing types for which interleaving diagrams will be constructed. Each element corresponds to a specific type.
· parameter4: phases (optional) - A list of length equal to `len(typ)` containing phase information for each type. If not provided, it defaults to `None`.

**Code Description**: The method constructs an interleaving diagram by performing the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: It initializes the result as a tensor product of identity diagrams (`cls.id()`) with factory-created swap operations based on the given types and phases.
2. **Internal Swaps for Inputs (n_legs_in - 1 times)**: For each type in `typ`, it performs leftward swaps to rearrange legs between positions `i * j + i + j` and `i * n_legs_in + j`. This process is repeated `n_legs_in - 1` times.
3. **External Swaps for Outputs (n_legs_out - 1 times)**: Similarly, it performs rightward swaps to rearrange legs between positions `i * j + i + j` and `i * n_legs_out + j`. This process is repeated `n_legs_out - 1` times.
4. **Return**: Finally, the constructed interleaving diagram represented as a tensor product of diagrams is returned.

**Note**: The method assumes that `cls.id()`, `factory(n_legs_in, n_legs_out, x, p)`, and `cls.swap(a, b)` are defined elsewhere in the codebase. Ensure these methods or functions are correctly implemented for this to work as intended.
**Output Example**: If `n_legs_in = 2`, `n_legs_out = 3`, `typ = ['A', 'B']`, and `phases = [None, None]`, the output might be a tensor product of diagrams where types 'A' and 'B' are interleaved through swap operations to match the specified number of legs for inputs and outputs.

# Documentation for `UserAuthenticationService`

## Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It provides secure mechanisms to authenticate users logging into the system and ensures that only authorized users can access specific features or resources.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Implements robust security measures to protect user credentials.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures that users are granted appropriate permissions based on their roles within the system.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Offers an optional MFA feature to enhance security.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the `UserAuthenticationService`, you need to provide a configuration object that includes necessary settings such as secret keys, token expiration times, and role mappings. Here is an example of how to configure it:

```javascript
const config = {
  jwtSecret: 'your_jwt_secret_key',
  tokenExpirationMinutes: 30,
  roles: {
    admin: ['user', 'admin'],
    user: []
  }
};

const authenticationService = new UserAuthenticationService(config);
```

### Authentication

To authenticate a user, you can use the `authenticate` method by providing the username and password. This method returns an access token if the credentials are valid.

```javascript
async function login(username, password) {
  try {
    const token = await authenticationService.authenticate(username, password);
    console.log('Authentication successful:', token);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication failed:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Token Validation

To validate a user's access token and ensure it is still valid, use the `validateToken` method. This method returns the decoded token if the token is valid.

```javascript
async function checkToken(token) {
  try {
    const decoded = await authenticationService.validateToken(token);
    console.log('Token is valid:', decoded);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Token validation failed:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control

To determine if a user has the required role to access certain resources, use the `hasRole` method. This method checks whether the user has one of the specified roles.

```javascript
async function checkUserRole(username) {
  try {
    const hasAdminRole = await authenticationService.hasRole(username, 'admin');
    console.log('User has admin role:', hasAdminRole);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Role check failed:', error.message);
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options

The `UserAuthenticationService` accepts a configuration object with the following properties:

- **jwtSecret**: A string representing the secret key used for signing JWTs.
- **tokenExpirationMinutes**: An integer specifying the number of minutes after which tokens expire.
- **roles**: An object mapping role names to an array of roles that users must have to be considered in this role.

## Error Handling

The `UserAuthenticationService` throws specific errors based on different failure scenarios:

- **InvalidCredentialsError**: Thrown when authentication fails due to invalid credentials.
- **TokenExpiredError**: Thrown when a token is provided but has expired.
- **RoleNotFoundError**: Thrown when a user does not have the required role.

## Conclusion

The `UserAuthenticationService` provides comprehensive and secure mechanisms for managing user authentication. By leveraging this service, you can ensure that your application's security requirements are met while providing a seamless experience for users.

For further details or assistance, please refer to the [API documentation](#api-documentation) section below.

## API Documentation

### Methods

#### `authenticate(username: string, password: string): Promise<string>`

- **Description**: Authenticates a user based on their username and password.
- **Parameters**:
  - `username`: The user's username.
  - `password`: The user's password.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to an access token if the credentials are valid.

#### `validateToken(token: string): Promise<any>`

- **Description**: Validates a provided JWT token and returns its decoded content.
- **Parameters**:
  - `token`: The JWT token to validate.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to the decoded token content if the token is valid, or rejects with an error.

#### `hasRole(username: string, role: string): Promise<boolean>`

- **Description**: Checks whether a user has a specified role.
- **Parameters**:
  - `username`: The user's username.
  - `role`: The role to check for the user.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to `true` if the user has the specified role, or `false` otherwise.

#### `initialize(config: Object): void`

- **Description**: Initializes the authentication service with a configuration object.
- **Parameters**:
  - `config`: An object containing configuration settings for the service
### FunctionDef method(a, b, x, phase)
**method**: The function of `method` is to recursively construct spiders or phase shifters based on given parameters.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: `a`: An integer representing one side of the spider.
· parameter2: `b`: An integer representing the other side of the spider.
· parameter3: `x`: A string, list, or any object that can be manipulated and passed through the spiders.
· parameter4: `phase` (optional): A phase value for phase shifters.

**Code Description**: The function `method` is designed to build spiders or phase shifters based on given parameters. It uses recursive calls and conditional logic to determine how to construct these spiders. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Phase Shifters Handling**: If the `phase` parameter is provided, it constructs a spider with one side set to 1 and applies a phase shifter before and after another call to `method`. This handles cases where phase shifters are required.

2. **Special Cases for Spiders**:
    - For specific pairs of `(a, b)` values like `(0, 1)`, `(1, 0)`, `(2, 1)`, or `(1, 2)`, it directly constructs the corresponding factory object.
    - If `a` and `b` are both 1, it returns an identity spider using `cls.id(x)`.

3. **Symmetry Handling**: 
    - If `a < b`, it recursively calls `method` with swapped parameters and applies a rotation to handle symmetry in the construction process.
    
4. **General Case for Odd and Even Numbers**:
    - If `b` is not 1, it splits the problem into two smaller subproblems by calling `method` twice: once with `a` and once with `b`, then concatenates the results using a tensor product (`@`).
    - If `a` is odd and `b` is 1, it recursively constructs half of the spider and applies a factory to complete the construction.
    - If `a` is even and `b` is 1, it divides `a` by 2 and recursively constructs two halves, then uses a factory to combine them.

**Note**: The function assumes that all input parameters are valid integers. It also relies on the existence of certain methods like `factory`, `cls.id(x)`, and `rotate()` which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Output Example**: Depending on the inputs, this function could return a sequence of spiders or phase shifters. For example:
- If called with `method(2, 1, "x")`, it might return a sequence like: `factory(1, 1, x) >> factory(2, 1, x)`.
- If called with specific phase values and parameters, it could generate a series of phase shifters interspersed with spiders.
