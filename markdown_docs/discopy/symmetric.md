### FunctionDef swap(cls, left, right)
**swap**: The function of `swap` is to create a diagram that swaps two wires.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: left - The type at the top left and bottom right.
· parameter2: right - The type at the top right and bottom left.

**Code Description**: 
The `swap` method in the `Diagram` class generates a diagram representing the swapping operation between two wire types, `left` and `right`. This function internally utilizes the `braid_factory` to create the necessary braid, which is then returned as the resulting diagram. Specifically, it calls `cls.braid(left, right)`, where `cls` refers to the current class (Diagram), to produce a diagram that swaps the specified wire types.

This method plays a crucial role in constructing more complex diagrams by enabling the swapping of individual wires within a larger network. It is often used as part of creating permutations or other intricate diagrams involving multiple wire manipulations.

**Note**: This function assumes that `left` and `right` are valid wire types, and it relies on the correct implementation of `braid_factory` to produce accurate results. The caller should ensure that the input types are properly defined and compatible within the context of the diagram being constructed.

**Output Example**: The output will be a Diagram object representing the swap operation between the specified `left` and `right` wire types. For example, if `left = Ty('a')` and `right = Ty('b')`, the return value would be a Diagram that swaps the 'a' and 'b' wires, effectively creating a diagram where these two types are interchanged.

### FunctionDef permute(self)
**permute**: The function of `permute` is to post-compose the current diagram with a permutation operation.
**Parameters**:
· xs: A list of integers representing a permutation.
**Code Description**: 
The `permute` method takes a list of integers, `xs`, which represents a permutation. It then applies this permutation to the current diagram by post-composing it with the resulting permutation diagram. The process involves creating a new permutation diagram using the `permutation` method and then composing it with the current diagram.

Here is a detailed analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The `permute` method first checks if the input list, `xs`, correctly represents a valid permutation by ensuring that it contains all integers from 0 to `len(xs) - 1`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
2. **Base Case Handling**: For permutations of length 1 or less, the method returns an identity diagram using `self.id(dom)`. This is because a permutation of length 1 does not change anything.
3. **Recursive Permutation Construction**: For longer permutations, the method recursively constructs the permutation by:
   - Identifying the first element in the permutation list, `i`.
   - Swapping the elements at positions 0 and `i` using `self.swap(dom[:i], dom[i]) @ dom[i + 1:]`. This effectively swaps the first element with the element at position `i`.
   - Recursively constructing the rest of the permutation for the remaining elements.
4. **Composition**: The constructed permutation diagram is then composed with the current diagram, resulting in a new diagram that represents the application of the specified permutation.

**Note**: Ensure that the input list `xs` correctly represents a valid permutation to avoid errors. The method assumes that the domain type `dom` matches the length of the permutation; otherwise, it uses `PRO(len(xs))` as the default domain type.

**Output Example**: 
Given a diagram representing a tensor with three wires and a permutation `[2, 0, 1]`, the output will be a new diagram where the wires are permuted according to this order. For example:
```python
x, y, z = Ty(), Ty(), Ty()
diagram = Tensor(x) @ Tensor(y) @ Tensor(z)
permuted_diagram = diagram.permute([2, 0, 1])
```
The `permuted_diagram` will effectively represent the tensor with wires ordered as `[z, x, y]`.
***
### FunctionDef to_hypergraph(self)
**to_hypergraph**: The function of `to_hypergraph` is to translate a diagram into a hypergraph.
**Parameters**: 
· No explicit parameters are defined within the method signature itself; however, it relies on the internal state of the `Diagram` object.

**Code Description**: 
The `to_hypergraph` method converts a `Diagram` instance into a corresponding `Hypergraph`. This conversion is facilitated by leveraging a `Category` and a `functor`, which are derived from the existing diagram's structure. The process involves creating a new category based on the current type factory (`self.ty_factory`) and arrow factory (`self.factory`). Then, it uses the hypergraph factory to apply a functor transformation, ultimately generating a hypergraph representation of the original diagram.

The method is closely related to other methods within the `Diagram` class. For example, the `simplify` method relies on this conversion by translating the diagram into a hypergraph and then back to a diagram, ensuring that simplification operations are consistent across different representations. Similarly, the `depth` method also references the `to_hypergraph` method to calculate the depth of the diagram based on its hypergraph representation.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `hypergraph_factory`, `functor`, and other relevant factories are properly initialized before calling this method.
- The output is a `Hypergraph` object, which captures the structure of the original diagram in a different format, potentially enabling different types of analysis or visualization.

**Output Example**: 
The return value would be an instance of the `Hypergraph` class. For example:
```
hypergraph = my_diagram.to_hypergraph()
```
***
### FunctionDef simplify(self)
**simplify**: The function of simplify is to translate a diagram into a hypergraph and then back into a simplified diagram.
**parameters**: This function does not take any explicit parameters; it relies on the internal state of the Diagram object.

**Code Description**: 
The `simplify` method in the `Diagram` class performs two main operations:
1. **Translation to Hypergraph**: It first converts the current diagram into a hypergraph representation using the `to_hypergraph` method. This conversion is essential for simplification as it allows the diagram's structure to be analyzed and potentially reduced.
2. **Back Translation and Simplification**: After obtaining the hypergraph, the method reverses the process by translating the hypergraph back into a simplified diagram. This step ensures that any simplifications or optimizations performed on the hypergraph are applied correctly to the original diagram’s representation.

The `simplify` method leverages the internal categories (`ty_factory`, `factory`) and functors from the `HypergraphFactory` to achieve these transformations. By translating between different representations, it maintains consistency in how the diagram is processed and simplified.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all necessary factories (e.g., `hypergraph_factory`, `functor`) are properly initialized before calling this method.
- The simplification process may depend on the specific implementation details of the `HypergraphFactory` and other related classes, so it’s crucial to understand these dependencies.
- This method is particularly useful for ensuring that complex diagrams can be simplified in a consistent manner, leveraging the strengths of both diagram and hypergraph representations.

**Output Example**: 
The return value would be an instance of the `Diagram` class representing the simplified version of the original diagram. For example:
```python
simplified_diagram = my_diagram.simplify()
```

This output reflects the result of applying simplification techniques to the original diagram, potentially making it more efficient or easier to analyze.
***
### FunctionDef _get_structure(self)
**_get_structure**: The function of _get_structure is to determine the structure of the Diagram instance based on whether hypergraph equality should be used.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `self` - An instance of the Diagram class, which contains all necessary attributes and methods related to diagram operations.

**Code Description**:
The `_get_structure` method in the Diagram class is responsible for determining the internal structure of a diagram. It returns either the hypergraph representation of the diagram or a tuple containing inside elements, codomain, and domain, depending on the `use_hypergraph_equality` attribute of the current instance.

If `self.use_hypergraph_equality` is set to True, it calls the `to_hypergraph` method to convert the diagram into a hypergraph. Otherwise, it returns a tuple consisting of `self.inside`, `self.cod`, and `self.dom`. The `inside` attribute likely contains the internal structure or elements of the diagram, while `cod` and `dom` represent the codomain and domain respectively.

This method is closely related to other methods within the Diagram class. For instance, the `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods use `_get_structure` to compare two diagrams based on their structures. By ensuring that these methods rely on consistent structure representations, they can effectively determine equality or hash values for diagram instances.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the internal attributes (`inside`, `cod`, `dom`) are properly initialized and up-to-date before calling this method.
- The output is either a Hypergraph object if hypergraph equality is used, or a tuple of elements representing the inside, codomain, and domain of the diagram.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.use_hypergraph_equality` is True:
```
hypergraph = my_diagram._get_structure()
```

If `self.use_hypergraph_equality` is False:
```
structure_tuple = my_diagram._get_structure()  # Returns (inside, cod, dom)
```
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to compare whether two Diagram instances are equal based on their structures.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `self` - An instance of the Diagram class.
· parameter2: `other` - Another object to be compared with the current Diagram instance.

**Code Description**:
The `__eq__` method in the Diagram class is designed to determine if two diagram instances are equal. It does this by first checking if the `other` object is an instance of the same factory (i.e., it belongs to the same type of Diagram). If so, it then compares the structures of both diagrams.

The structure comparison is performed using the `_get_structure` method. This method returns either a Hypergraph representation or a tuple containing the inside elements, codomain (`cod`), and domain (`dom`) based on the `use_hypergraph_equality` attribute of the current instance. If hypergraph equality is enabled (i.e., `self.use_hypergraph_equality` is True), `_get_structure` returns the Hypergraph representation. Otherwise, it returns a tuple.

The `__eq__` method then compares these structures using the `==` operator. This ensures that two diagrams are considered equal if their internal representations match, either in terms of hypergraphs or in terms of elements, codomain, and domain tuples.

This approach is consistent with how equality is determined for other complex data types in Python, where custom comparison logic can be defined to suit specific needs.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `use_hypergraph_equality` attribute and internal attributes (`inside`, `cod`, `dom`) are properly initialized and up-to-date before calling `_get_structure`.
- The method relies on the Hypergraph class for hypergraph equality checks, which is imported from elsewhere in the project.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# If hypergraph equality is used
if my_diagram.use_hypergraph_equality:
    assert my_diagram._get_structure() == other_diagram._get_structure()

# If not using hypergraph equality
else:
    assert (my_diagram.inside, my_diagram.cod, my_diagram.dom) == \
           (other_diagram.inside, other_diagram.cod, other_diagram.dom)
```
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to compute a hash value based on the internal structure of the Diagram instance.

**Parameters**: 
· parameter1: `self` - An instance of the Diagram class, which contains all necessary attributes and methods related to diagram operations.

**Code Description**: The `__hash__` method in the Diagram class computes a unique identifier (hash value) for each instance based on its internal structure. This is achieved by calling the `_get_structure` method, which determines whether to use hypergraph equality or a tuple representation of the inside, codomain, and domain.

The `_get_structure` method checks if `self.use_hypergraph_equality` is set to True. If it is, then the diagram's structure is converted into a Hypergraph object using the `to_hypergraph` method. Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing `self.inside`, `self.cod`, and `self.dom`.

By relying on `_get_structure`, `__hash__` ensures that hash values are consistent with how diagrams are compared for equality. This consistency is crucial for operations like adding Diagram instances to sets or using them as keys in dictionaries.

**Note**: Ensure that the internal attributes (`inside`, `cod`, `dom`) are properly initialized and up-to-date before calling `_get_structure`. The output of `__hash__` should be a unique integer value, which can vary based on the structure representation chosen by `_get_structure`.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming use_hypergraph_equality is False
hash_value = my_diagram.__hash__()  # Returns an integer hash value

# If use_hypergraph_equality is True and to_hypergraph returns a Hypergraph object
hash_value = my_diagram.__hash__()  # Returns a hash value based on the hypergraph structure
```
***
### FunctionDef hypergraph_equality(cls)
**hypergraph_equality**: The function of hypergraph_equality is to temporarily enable the use of hypergraph equality within a context manager scope.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
This function acts as a context manager that temporarily enables the use of hypergraph equality in the `Diagram` class. It works by saving the current state of the `use_hypergraph_equality` attribute, setting it to `True`, and then yielding control back to the caller. Once the block of code within which this context manager is used has completed execution, the original value of `use_hypergraph_equality` is restored using a `try...finally` block.

1. **Line 1**: The function starts by creating a temporary variable `tmp` and assigning it the current state of `cls.use_hypergraph_equality`. This ensures that the original setting can be restored later.
2. **Line 2**: The value of `cls.use_hypergraph_equality` is then set to `True`, allowing hypergraph equality to be used within the context of this function call.
3. **Line 4**: The `yield` statement indicates that this function acts as a context manager, and control can be passed back to the caller while maintaining the current state (i.e., with `use_hypergraph_equality` set to `True`).
4. **Lines 6-7**: After the block of code within which this context manager is used has completed execution, the original value of `cls.use_hypergraph_equality` is restored using a `finally` block.

**Note**: Developers should be aware that changing the state of `use_hypergraph_equality` to `True` can affect how equality checks are performed in the `Diagram` class. It is important to use this context manager appropriately and ensure that all necessary cleanup occurs when exiting the context, as indicated by the `finally` block.
***
### FunctionDef depth(self)
**depth**: The function of depth is to calculate the depth of a symmetric diagram.
**Parameters**: 
· No explicit parameters are defined within the method signature itself.

**Code Description**: The `depth` method calculates the depth of a given symmetric diagram by leveraging its hypergraph representation. This calculation is performed through a two-step process:
1. **Translation to Hypergraph**: The `to_hypergraph()` method is called on the current `Diagram` instance, converting it into a corresponding `Hypergraph`. This translation captures the structural complexity of the original diagram in a different format.
2. **Depth Calculation**: Once the diagram has been translated into a hypergraph, the depth of this hypergraph is calculated using the `depth()` method of the `Hypergraph` class.

This approach ensures that the depth calculation is based on a structured and potentially more analyzable representation of the original diagram. The use of hypergraphs can help in understanding complex relationships within the diagram, making it easier to compute its depth accurately.

The relationship with other methods within the project is clear: `depth` relies on `to_hypergraph` for translating the diagram into a hypergraph format before performing the actual depth calculation. This interplay ensures that the depth of a diagram can be determined consistently across different representations and operations.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary factories (e.g., `hypergraph_factory`, `functor`) are properly initialized before calling this method to avoid any runtime errors.

**Output Example**: The return value is an integer representing the depth of the hypergraph, which corresponds to the depth of the original diagram. For example:
```
depth_value = my_diagram.depth()
```

It takes two parameters, `left` and `right`, which are expected to be instances of types that can represent the inputs to a braid operation within a symmetric diagram. Specifically, these inputs should be compatible with the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) attributes defined in the parent classes.

The method performs initialization by calling two constructors from its parent classes:
1. `balanced.Braid.__init__(self, left, right)`: This call initializes the braid operation using the provided `left` and `right` parameters. The `Braid` class is responsible for setting up the basic structure of the braid within a balanced category.
2. `Box.__init__(self, name, dom, cod)`: Although no explicit `name`, `dom`, or `cod` are passed directly to this call in the provided code snippet, it suggests that these attributes might be derived from the `left` and `right` parameters or set up internally by the `Braid` class. The `Box` class ensures that the braid operation is represented as a box within a diagram, maintaining its structural integrity.

By inheriting from both `balanced.Braid` and `Box`, the `Swap` class can handle operations specific to braiding while also maintaining the properties of a box within a diagram. This dual inheritance allows for flexibility in constructing complex diagrams where braids are integrated with other diagrammatic elements.

The initialization process ensures that the `Swap` instance is properly configured to represent a braid operation between two components, adhering to the rules and constraints defined by both the `Braid` and `Box` classes. This setup is crucial for further operations such as composing diagrams or performing categorical computations within the context of quantum mechanics.

**Note**: Ensure that the `left` and `right` parameters provided are valid types expected by the parent classes. The initialization process relies on these inputs being correctly specified to avoid errors during diagram construction or manipulation. Additionally, understanding the context within which braids operate (i.e., in a balanced category) is crucial for proper use of this class.

### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return a new Swap gate with the left and right sides swapped.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: The `dagger` method returns a new instance of the `Swap` class where the positions of `self.left` and `self.right` are inverted. Essentially, it creates the inverse operation of the current Swap gate. In quantum computing and symmetric categories, this is often referred to as the adjoint or daggered version of the gate.

This method plays a crucial role in ensuring that operations can be reversed or undone within circuits. For example, if you have two qubits swapped using `Swap(qubit1, qubit2)`, applying `.dagger()` will swap them back to their original positions using `Swap(qubit2, qubit1)`.

In the context of the project, this method is used in several test cases and circuit transformations. For instance, in `test/quantum/tk.py/test_Circuit_from_tk`, it ensures that certain operations are reversible by comparing the result of applying a gate followed by its daggered version to an identity operation. This demonstrates how the `dagger` method contributes to maintaining the integrity and reversibility of quantum circuits.

**Note**: Ensure that when using this method, you always pass Swap instances as arguments since it relies on the internal structure of these objects.
**Output Example**: If `swap_gate = Swap(qubit1, qubit2)`, then `swap_gate.dagger()` would return a new instance where the roles of `qubit1` and `qubit2` are swapped.

### FunctionDef _get_structure(self)
**_get_structure**: The function of _get_structure is to determine the structure of the current Trace instance based on certain conditions.
· self: An instance of the Trace class.

**Code Description**: 
The `_get_structure` method evaluates whether the `use_hypergraph_equality` attribute is set to `True`. If it is, the method calls the superclass's `_get_structure` method. Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the class type (`type(self)`), the domain (`self.dom`), the codomain (`self.cod`), and the result of calling `_get_structure` on the argument (`self.arg._get_structure()`).

This function plays a critical role in determining how the Trace object should be represented or compared based on whether hypergraph equality is being used. If `use_hypergraph_equality` is `False`, it ensures that the structure includes details about the class type, domain, codomain, and the internal structure of the argument.

The method references other components within the project, such as `_get_structure` from the `Bubble` class (called via `self.arg._get_structure()`). This indicates that the structure determination process is recursive and involves breaking down the object into its constituent parts for comparison or representation purposes. 

In the context of the `Feedback` class, which inherits from `Bubble`, this method ensures consistency in how Trace objects are handled during operations involving feedback diagrams. The `Feedback` class uses `_get_structure` to determine its structure when it is part of a larger diagram.

**Note**: Ensure that the `use_hypergraph_equality` attribute is correctly set based on the requirements of your application. Incorrect settings can lead to incorrect structural representations or comparisons.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.use_hypergraph_equality` is `False`, `_get_structure` returns `(Trace, self.dom, self.cod, self.arg._get_structure())`. If it is `True`, it returns the result of calling the superclass's `_get_structure` method.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, other)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to apply the Functor to an input, transforming it according to the rules defined by the Functor.
**Parameters**: 
· other: The input to be transformed.

**Code Description**: The `__call__` method in the `Functor` class is designed to handle the transformation of inputs based on the rules defined within the Functor. This method acts as a proxy for applying the Functor's transformation logic to an incoming argument, ensuring that the Functor's behavior can be invoked directly as if it were a function.

The implementation checks whether the input `other` is an instance of `Swap`. If so, it returns a new `Diagram` where the atomic types are swapped according to the rules defined by the Functor. This allows for the manipulation of diagrammatic structures in a consistent and predictable manner. For any other type of input, it delegates the call to the superclass's `__call__` method.

This method is crucial for implementing the behavior of Functors in category theory, where transformations are applied to objects and morphisms within a category.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `other` is correctly typed according to the Functor's design. Incorrect types can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
**Output Example**: If the input `other` is an instance of `Swap`, the output will be a new `Diagram` with the atomic types swapped as per the Functor's rules. For other inputs, it will return the result of calling the superclass's `__call__` method.
