## ClassDef Ob
**Ob**: The function of Ob is to represent rigid objects within the category theory framework.
**Attributes**:
· name: The name of the object.
· z: The winding number.

**Code Description**: 
The `Ob` class represents rigid objects, which are fundamental elements in the category-theoretic framework. Rigid objects have left and right adjoints (`l` and `r`), making them essential for defining adjoint relationships within categories. Here is a detailed analysis of each part of the code:

- **Initialization**: The constructor `__init__` initializes an object with a given name and winding number (z). It performs type checking on the winding number to ensure it is an integer.
  
- **Adjoints**: Properties `l` and `r` are defined as properties that return new instances of `Ob`, representing the left and right adjoint objects, respectively. The winding numbers are adjusted by -1 for `l` and +1 for `r`.

- **Equality and Hashing**: The `__eq__` method ensures equality is determined based on both name and winding number. The `__hash__` method uses a string representation of the object to generate a hash, which is important for set operations.

- **String Representation**: The `__repr__` and `__str__` methods provide human-readable representations of the object, with special handling for negative winding numbers.

- **Serialization and Deserialization**: The `__setstate__` method handles backward compatibility by removing deprecated state variables before calling the superclass's implementation. This ensures that objects can be deserialized correctly even if their internal structure has changed over time.

**Relationships with Callers**:
The `Ob` class is called by the `Ty` class, which represents rigid types. The `Ty` class uses instances of `Ob` to construct and manipulate categories where adjoint relationships are defined. Specifically, the `l` and `r` properties of `Ty` rely on the corresponding methods in `Ob` to create adjoint types.

**Note**: Ensure that when creating or manipulating `Ob` objects, the winding number (z) is correctly set according to the category-theoretic rules. Incorrect values can lead to logical errors in adjoint relationships and other category operations.

**Output Example**: An example of an `Ob` object might be created as follows:
```python
obj = Ob(name='A', z=1)
```
This would create an object named 'A' with a winding number of 1. Its left adjoint (`l`) and right adjoint (`r`) can then be accessed and manipulated accordingly.
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the object's state from a given dictionary.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: state - A dictionary containing the object’s state information.

**Code Description**:
The method `__setstate__` is used in Python classes that implement the `pickle` module for serialization and deserialization. Specifically, it is called during the process of restoring an object's state from a serialized form (a dictionary in this case).

1. **Backward Compatibility Handling**: The first part of the function checks if the key `_z` exists in the provided state dictionary (`if '_z' in state`). This line ensures that the code can handle backward compatibility, meaning it can deal with older states that might have included a `_z` attribute.

2. **State Restoration**:
    - If `_z` is found in `state`, its value is assigned to the object's `z` attribute using `self.z = state['_z']`. This step restores the `z` attribute from the serialized form.
    - The line `del state['_z']` removes the `_z` key from the dictionary, ensuring that it is not included in subsequent operations or states.

3. **Superclass Restoration**: After handling any backward compatibility issues and restoring specific attributes (if necessary), the function calls `super().__setstate__(state)`. This ensures that the object's state is fully restored by allowing the superclass to handle its own state restoration process, if applicable.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that their classes properly implement `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods for serialization and deserialization. The use of backward compatibility checks like `_z` in `__setstate__` can help maintain code stability over time as attribute names or state structures evolve.
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self, name, z)
**__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize an instance of the `Ob` class.
· parameter1: `name`: A string representing the name of the object being initialized.
· parameter2: `z`: An integer with a default value of 0, used as an attribute for the object.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Ob` class. It sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes and performing any necessary setup tasks. Specifically, it performs the following actions:

1. **Validation of Input Parameters**: The parameter `z` is validated using the `assert_isinstance` function from the `discopy.utils.assert_isinstance` module. This ensures that `z` is an integer, raising a `TypeError` if it is not.
2. **Attribute Assignment**: It assigns the value of `name` to the instance variable `self.name`.
3. **Inheritance Initialization**: The method calls the `__init__` method of the superclass using `super().__init__(name)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is also executed, allowing for proper inheritance and setup.

**Note**: Ensure that the input parameter `z` is always an integer to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, be aware that calling the superclass's constructor with only one argument might have implications if the superclass expects more parameters or a different order of arguments. Always check the documentation or implementation details of the parent class to ensure correct usage.
***
### FunctionDef l(self)
**l**: The function of l is to return the left adjoint of the object.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `l` method returns an instance of the same class (`type(self)`) with the name and z-coordinate adjusted by decrementing the z-coordinate by 1. Specifically, it computes a new object that is the left adjoint of the current object. This implies there might be some underlying categorical or algebraic structure where the `z` value represents an index or coordinate in this space.

Here is a detailed analysis:
- The method `l` is defined within the class `Ob`, which suggests it operates on objects with attributes such as `name` and `z`.
- `self.name` refers to the name of the current object, which remains unchanged when computing the left adjoint.
- `self.z - 1` indicates that the z-coordinate (or index) of the new object is derived by decrementing the z-coordinate of the original object by 1. This operation implies a transformation or mapping in some categorical structure.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the class `Ob` has been properly defined and initialized before calling this method.
- The `z` attribute should be an integer, as it is being decremented by 1.
- If the z-coordinate of the object is already at its minimum value (e.g., 0), decrementing it will result in a non-existent or undefined state. Handle such cases appropriately within your application.

**Output Example**: 
Suppose there is an instance `obj` of class `Ob` with attributes `name = "example"` and `z = 3`. Then, calling `l()` on this object would return another instance of `Ob` with the same name `"example"` but a z-coordinate of `2`. Therefore, the output might look like:
```python
new_obj = obj.l()  # new_obj.name == "example", new_obj.z == 2
```

This example illustrates how the method `l` transforms an object by adjusting its z-coordinate while keeping its name unchanged.
***
### FunctionDef r(self)
**r**: The function of r is to return the right adjoint of the object.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `r` method is defined within the `Ob` class and returns an instance of the same type as the current object (`type(self)`). It takes the name and z-coordinate (self.name, self.z + 1) of the current object and constructs a new object with these values. Specifically, the `z` coordinate of the returned object is incremented by one compared to the original object.
This method effectively computes the right adjoint of an object in categorical terms, where the name remains unchanged but the z-coordinate undergoes a transformation.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the class `Ob` and its attributes (`name`, `z`) are properly defined and initialized before calling this method. 
- The `type(self)` call ensures that the returned object is of the same type as the current instance, maintaining consistency within the class hierarchy.
- This method assumes a specific transformation rule for the z-coordinate; any changes to this rule should be reflected here.

**Output Example**: If there is an instance of `Ob` with name "A" and z-coordinate 3, calling `r()` on it would return another instance of `Ob` with the same name "A" but a new z-coordinate value of 4.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to compare two `Ob` objects for equality based on their attributes.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - The instance of the current class that the method is being called on.
· parameter2: other - An object that needs to be compared with the current instance.

**Code Description**: This function checks if the current `Ob` object and another object (`other`) are equal. It does this by ensuring two conditions:
1. The objects of type `cat.Ob` (which presumably refers to a base class or interface) are also equal using the `__eq__` method from that class.
2. The `z` attribute of both objects is equal.

The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, indicating that the two `Ob` objects are considered equal; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: Ensure that the `other` object being compared is indeed an instance of `cat.Ob` to avoid potential type errors or unexpected behavior.
**Output Example**: If you have two `Ob` instances with identical `z` attributes and they are both instances of `cat.Ob`, the function will return `True`. For example:
```python
ob1 = Ob(5)
ob2 = Ob(5)
print(ob1 == ob2)  # Output: True

ob3 = Ob(6)
print(ob1 == ob3)  # Output: False
```
This example demonstrates the function's behavior with two `Ob` objects, where equality is determined by both their type and attribute values.
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to return a unique hash value representing the object.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method returns a unique integer that serves as an identifier for the object. It uses the string representation (`repr(self)`) of the object, which includes all its attributes and state information, to generate this hash value via the built-in `hash()` function. This ensures that two objects with identical states will have the same hash value.
The use of `repr(self)` instead of a simpler method like `str(self)` is important because it provides a more complete representation of the object, which can be crucial for accurate hashing in cases where the object's state includes non-printable or complex data structures.

**Note**: 
- The returned hash value should remain consistent as long as the object’s state does not change. This means that if you modify an attribute of the object after it has been hashed, the previous hash value will no longer be valid.
- Hash collisions can occur, where different objects have the same hash value. While this is less likely with `repr(self)`, it's important to handle such cases appropriately in your application.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of the `Ob` class has the state `{'a': 1, 'b': [2, 3]}`, then calling `hash(instance)` might return a value like `-578940236546789`. The exact output will vary each time you run the program due to how Python's hashing mechanism works internally.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of `__repr__` is to return a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate the object.
**parameters**: 
· self: Represents the instance of the class.

**Code Description**: The `__repr__` method in the `Ob` class generates a string that represents the object when printed or displayed. This string includes the name of the factory function and the name of the object, along with an optional `z` value if it is set.
- **factory_name(type(self))**: This part retrieves the full name of the class using the `factory_name` function from the `discopy.utils` module. The `type(self)` argument provides the class type, which is then formatted into a string like "grammar.pregroup.Word".
- **repr(self.name)**: This converts the `name` attribute of the object to its string representation.
- **f"({repr(self.name)}{', z=' + repr(self.z) if self.z else ''})"**: This f-string concatenates the name and optional `z` value into a single string. If `self.z` is set, it includes "z=" followed by the string representation of `self.z`.

**Note**: Ensure that all attributes (`name`, `z`) are properly defined in the class to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: For an object with `name = 'example'` and `z = 42`, the output would be:
```
"Ob('example', z='42')"
```
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the instance.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__str__` method returns a string that provides a human-readable representation of the current object instance. Specifically, it concatenates the name of the object with a left or right label based on the value of `self.z`. If `self.z` is negative, it appends '.l' to the end of the name and negates the value of `self.z`; if `self.z` is positive, it appends '.r' without any modification. This method ensures that each instance can be easily identified by its name and a directional label.
- The first part of the return statement, `str(self.name)`, converts the object's `name` attribute into a string. 
- The second part, `- self.z * '.l' if self.z < 0 else self.z * '.r'`, checks the value of `self.z`. If `self.z` is negative, it appends '.l' to the name and negates the absolute value of `self.z`; if `self.z` is positive or zero, it appends '.r' multiplied by the value of `self.z`.
**Note**: When using this method, ensure that the `name` attribute exists and is properly defined for each instance. Also, pay attention to how the `z` attribute influences the string representation.
**Output Example**: If an object has a `name` of "NodeA" and `z` of -3, the output would be "NodeA-3.l". If `z` is 2, the output would be "NodeA2.r".
***
### FunctionDef to_tree(self)
**to_tree**: The function of `to_tree` is to convert the current object into a tree representation.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `to_tree` method first calls the `to_tree` method from its superclass using `super().to_tree()`. It then checks if the attribute `self.z` exists. If it does, this attribute is added to the tree representation as a key-value pair where the key is 'z' and the value is `self.z`. Finally, the updated tree dictionary is returned.

The method starts by ensuring that any common logic for converting an object into a tree structure defined in its superclass is executed. Afterward, it checks if there are additional attributes (specifically `self.z`) to be included in this representation. This allows for customization or extension of the basic tree structure provided by the superclass.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.z` exists before attempting to add it to the dictionary; otherwise, an error will occur.
- The method assumes that the `to_tree` method from the superclass returns a dictionary, which is then modified and returned here.
- This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to represent your object's state as a tree structure for further processing or visualization.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.z` has a value of 'example_value', the output might look like:
```
{
    "z": "example_value"
}
```
***
### FunctionDef from_tree(cls, tree)
**from_tree**: The function of `from_tree` is to create an instance of the class based on a given tree structure.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `tree`: A dictionary containing the name and optionally a z value, which represents the tree structure from which the Ob instance will be created.

**Code Description**:
The `from_tree` method takes a single argument, `tree`, which is expected to be a dictionary. This dictionary must contain a key `'name'` whose associated value is used as the name for the new `Ob` instance. Additionally, it may optionally include a key `'z'` with an integer value representing some attribute or property of the object.

1. The method first extracts the value corresponding to the key `'name'` from the input dictionary and assigns it to the variable `name`.
2. It then retrieves the value for the optional key `'z'`, defaulting to 0 if this key is not present in the dictionary, and assigns this value to the variable `z`.
3. Finally, an instance of the class (assumed to be named `Ob`) is created using the `cls` keyword, which refers to the current class (`from_tree`), with the parameters `name` and `z`.

This method ensures that the new `Ob` object can be initialized based on a predefined tree structure, making it easier to instantiate objects in scenarios where such structures are common.

**Note**: Ensure that the input dictionary always contains the `'name'` key. If the `'z'` key is not present, it will default to 0, but this may need to be adjusted depending on the specific requirements of your application.

**Output Example**: 
If `tree = {'name': 'A', 'z': 2}`, then `from_tree(tree)` would return an instance of `Ob` with name set to `'A'` and z set to `2`. If `tree = {'name': 'B'}`, the returned instance would have a name set to `'B'` and z set to `0`.

### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a given dictionary.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: state (dict)
    - A dictionary containing the state information used to reconstruct the object.

**Code Description**: 
The method `__setstate__` is designed for object serialization and deserialization, specifically when restoring the internal state of an object after it has been pickled. The function first checks if a key `_z` exists in the provided state dictionary; if present, this indicates backward compatibility with older versions of the codebase that used a different state representation. To ensure consistency across different versions, the method removes the `_z` key from the state to avoid conflicts. After handling any backward-compatibility issues, it calls `super().__setstate__(state)` to restore the object's state using the updated dictionary.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the state dictionary provided during deserialization contains all necessary information for reconstructing the object.
- Be aware of potential version incompatibilities and handle them gracefully by cleaning up old keys as shown.
***
### FunctionDef assert_isadjoint(self, other)
**assert_isadjoint**: The function of assert_isadjoint is to raise an error if two rigid types are not adjoints.
· self: The current Ty instance.
· other: The alleged right adjoint.

**Code Description**: 
The `assert_isadjoint` method checks whether the given type `other` is indeed the right adjoint of the current type `self`. This is done by verifying that applying the `r` method to `self` results in `other`, and vice versa. If either condition fails, an `AxiomError` is raised.

1. **Verification Process**:
   - First, it checks if applying the `r` method (which computes the right adjoint) to the current type `self` equals `other`. This ensures that `other` could potentially be the right adjoint of `self`.
   - Similarly, it checks if applying the `r` method to `other` results in `self`, ensuring that `self` is indeed a left adjoint of `other`.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If either condition fails, an `AxiomError` is raised. This indicates that there is a violation of the adjoint relationship between the two types.

3. **Functional Relationship with Callees**:
   - The method plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and correctness within the category theory framework implemented by this codebase. By ensuring that only valid adjoints are recognized, it helps prevent logical errors and maintains the integrity of categorical structures.
   - It is typically called internally during operations where adjoint relationships need to be verified, such as in type checking or construction of certain categorical objects.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `r` method correctly computes the right adjoint. Any issues here could lead to false positives or negatives when verifying adjoint relationships.
- Proper error handling is essential to provide clear feedback when an invalid adjoint relationship is detected, ensuring robustness in the system.
***
### FunctionDef l(self)
**l**: The function of l is to compute the left adjoint of the type.
**parameters**: This method does not have any parameters other than `self`.
**Code Description**: 
The `l` method within the `Ty` class returns the left adjoint of the current object's type. Specifically, it constructs a new `Ty` instance by applying the `l` operation to each element in the reversed version of the inside list (which represents the structure of the type) and then uses the factory method to create the resulting `Ty`.

This method is crucial for operations involving adjoint types in categorical quantum mechanics or similar domains where such transformations are necessary.

**Note**: When calling this method, ensure that the current object's `inside` attribute contains valid elements that can undergo the `l` operation. The method assumes that the factory used to create new `Ty` instances is available and correctly configured.

**Output Example**: If the current `Ty` instance has an `inside` list containing types `[A, B]`, then calling `self.l()` would result in a new `Ty` object constructed from the reversed and transformed types `[B.l, A.l]`.
***
### FunctionDef r(self)
**r**: The function of r is to compute the right adjoint of the type.
**parameters**:
· self: The current Ty instance.

**Code Description**: 
The `r` method computes the right adjoint of the given type `self`. It does this by reversing the order of elements in `self.inside`, and then applying the `.r` method to each element. This process effectively mirrors the structure of the original type, thereby generating its right adjoint.

From a functional perspective, when called within the context of rigid types in the discopy library, the `r` function plays a crucial role in ensuring that operations involving adjoint types are correctly defined and validated. Specifically, this method is used to generate the dual structure necessary for certain categorical constructions, such as the composition of morphisms in a symmetric monoidal category.

The relationship with its callers in the project can be understood through its use within `assert_isadjoint`. Here, it ensures that the adjoint relationship between two types holds true. Additionally, when used in conjunction with the `__rshift__` operator, it helps define how rigid types interact during operations like composition, ensuring that the resulting type is correctly formed.

**Note**: Ensure that the input to `self.inside` contains valid elements for which the `.r` method is defined and meaningful. Misuse could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: If `self = Ty([x, y])`, where `x.r` and `y.r` are well-defined, then `self.r()` would return `Ty([y.r, x.r])`.
***
### FunctionDef z(self)
**z**: The function of z is to return the winding number associated with a type of length 1.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· self: An instance of Ty, which represents a type within the rigid.py module.

**Code Description**: The `z` method in the `Ty` class returns the winding number for types of length 1. This method is designed to be called on instances of `Ty`, and it ensures that only atomic types (types with a length of 1) are processed by asserting this condition using `assert_isatomic`. If the type does not have a length of 1, an assertion error will be raised.

The `z` method accesses the first element within the `inside` attribute of the current instance and calls its own `z` method recursively. This recursive call is crucial for handling nested types or structures where each level might need to compute its winding number independently.

**Note**: The use of `assert_isatomic` ensures that only atomic types (types with a length of 1) are processed, preventing errors when non-atomic types are passed. Developers should ensure that the type they pass to this method is indeed atomic before calling it to avoid runtime errors.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `Ty` represents a type with a single component and its internal structure has a winding number of 3, then:

```python
result = z()
# result would be 3
```

This example assumes that the internal structure's `z` method returns 3 when called.
***
### FunctionDef __lshift__(self, other)
**__lshift__**: The function of __lshift__ is to perform a specific operation on two objects of the Ty class.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - An instance of the Ty class representing the current object.
· parameter2: other - Another instance of the Ty class used in the operation.

**Code Description**: This method defines how the `__lshift__` operator is handled when applied to instances of the `Ty` class. The code uses a bitwise shift left (`@`) operator, which is not a standard Python operator but could be overloaded for custom behavior within this context. It returns a new instance where the operation between self and other has been performed.

The method implementation simply calls `self @ other.l`, indicating that it combines the current object with another object's attribute `l`. This suggests that `@` might represent some form of composition or combination logic specific to the `Ty` class, possibly in a domain such as category theory or a similar abstract algebraic structure.

**Note**: Ensure that `other.l` is valid and defined for all instances of `Ty` used in this operation. The method assumes that `l` is an attribute of the `other` object which should be compatible with the current instance's logic.

**Output Example**: If `self` represents a type or category, and `other.l` represents another transformation or morphism, then the output would be a new transformed type or composition of transformations. For example:
```python
# Assuming Ty represents a type in some categorical context
t1 = Ty()
t2 = Ty()

result = t1 << t2  # This would return the result of combining t1 and t2 using the defined operation.
```
The `result` will be an instance that reflects the combined behavior or transformation represented by `self @ other.l`.
***
### FunctionDef __rshift__(self, other)
**__rshift__**: The function of __rshift__ is to return the composition of two types where the second type is shifted to the right.

**parameters**: 
· self: The current Ty instance.
· other: The type that will be composed with the current type after shifting it to the right.

**Code Description**: The `__rshift__` method in the `Ty` class facilitates the composition of two rigid types, ensuring that operations involving adjoint types are correctly defined and validated. Specifically, this operator overloading method allows for a clear and concise way to compose types by shifting one type to the right relative to another.

The method performs the following steps:
1. It takes the current `Ty` instance (`self`) and an additional `other` type.
2. It returns the composition of these two types, where the `other` type is shifted to the right of `self`.

To achieve this, it leverages the `r` method (which computes the right adjoint) on the `other` type before composing them. This ensures that the resulting type structure correctly reflects the categorical properties required for operations like composition in a symmetric monoidal category.

In terms of its relationship with callees in the project:
- The `__rshift__` method is used within other methods or classes to define how rigid types interact during operations such as composition, ensuring that the resulting type is correctly formed and adheres to categorical principles.
- It works closely with the `r` method to ensure that the adjoint relationship between two types holds true. For instance, when used in conjunction with `assert_isadjoint`, it helps validate that the adjoint relationship is correctly defined.

**Note**: Ensure that both `self.inside` and `other.inside` contain valid elements for which the `.r` method is defined and meaningful. Misuse could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: If `self = Ty([x, y])` and `other = Ty([z])`, where `x.r`, `y.r`, and `z.r` are well-defined, then `self >> other` would return a new type equivalent to the composition of `Ty([x, y])` and the adjoint of `Ty([z])`. This could be represented as `Ty([x, y, z.r])` in a simplified categorical context.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input data is properly formatted as a list of dictionaries.
- The `process_data` method applies predefined transformations and filters. Custom transformations can be added by extending this class or overriding methods.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the `DataProcessor` class for data manipulation tasks.
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to reverse the order of elements within a Layer instance.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (bool) - If set to True, it rotates by reversing the left context; if False, it reverses the right context.

**Code Description**: This method `rotate` takes an optional boolean argument `left`. It returns a new instance of the same type as the current object (`self`). The elements within the Layer are processed based on the value of `left`.

1. **Reversing the Elements**: The function first converts the current Layer into a list using `list(self)`. This list is then reversed with `[::-1]`, effectively changing the order of its elements.
2. **Context Transformation**: For each element in this reversed list, it checks if `left` is True or False:
   - If `left` is True, it applies the transformation by taking the left context (`x.l`) for each element.
   - If `left` is False, it applies the transformation by taking the right context (`x.r`) for each element.
3. **Returning the New Instance**: The transformed elements are then used to create a new instance of the same Layer type as the original object and return this new instance.

**Note**: Ensure that the input Layer has elements with both left and right contexts defined, otherwise, an error might occur during the transformation.

**Output Example**: Suppose we have a Layer instance with elements `['a', 'b', 'c']`, where each element has both a left context (`l`) and a right context (`r`). If we call `rotate(left=True)`, it would reverse the order of the contexts, resulting in an output like `[('c'.l, 'b'.r), ('b'.l, 'a'.r)]`. Conversely, if `rotate(left=False)` is called, the result would be `[('c'.r, 'b'.l), ('b'.r, 'a'.l)]`.

### FunctionDef curry(self, n, left)
**curry**: The `curry` function is used to transform a rigid diagram into another diagram using cups and caps.
**Parameters**:
· n: An integer indicating the number of rightmost boxes to curry (default value is 1).
· left: A boolean flag indicating whether to use left or right adjoints for currying (default value is `True`).

**Code Description**: The `curry` method in the `Diagram` class handles the transformation of a rigid diagram into another diagram by using cups and caps. This operation effectively rearranges the structure of the diagram, making it useful for various categorical transformations.

The function first checks if the `left` parameter is set to `True`. If so, it splits the domain (`self.dom`) of the current diagram into two parts: a base part that excludes the last `n` boxes and an exponent part consisting of these `n` boxes. Then, it constructs a new diagram by applying cups (using `self.caps(exponent, exponent.l)`) to connect the base and exponent parts, followed by connecting this structure with the original diagram (`self @ exponent.l`).

If `left` is set to `False`, the function performs a similar operation but splits the domain into two different parts: a new base part that includes all boxes except for the last `n` boxes, and an exponent part consisting of these `n` boxes. The cups are then constructed using `self.caps(left @ right, right.l @ left)`, where `left` is the new base and `right` is the exponent.

The relationship with its callees in the project is that both methods rely on the `caps` method to construct the necessary diagrams for currying. The `caps` method is responsible for creating nested caps, which are used as building blocks for the transformation.

**Note**: Ensure that the number of boxes specified by `n` does not exceed the length of the domain (`self.dom`) to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: Given a diagram with three boxes and setting `n = 2`, if `left = True`, the output will be a new diagram where the last two boxes are connected using cups, followed by connecting this structure with the first box. If `left = False`, the last two boxes are still connected using cups, but the arrangement of the first box is different in the final diagram.
***
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to perform a half-turn rotation on a diagram, which can be called with `.l` or `.r`.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (bool) - If set to `True`, the rotation will operate from the left; if `False`, it operates from the right.

**Code Description**: The rotate function is responsible for applying a half-turn rotation to a given diagram. This operation effectively flips the diagram horizontally, either starting from the left or the right depending on the value of the `left` parameter. 

The function first determines the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) based on whether the rotation should be performed from the left or the right. It then iterates over the layers within the diagram in reverse order to construct a new sequence of layers with the specified rotation applied. Finally, it returns a new diagram created using these modified layers.

The rotate function is closely related to another operation called `conjugate` in the pivotal.py module. The conjugate method essentially performs a horizontal reflection of the diagram by first applying the rotate method and then taking the dagger (dagger operation) of the result. This relationship highlights how different transformations can be combined to achieve more complex operations within the discopy framework.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that you understand the implications of rotating from the left or right, as it affects the overall structure and interpretation of the diagram. Additionally, the rotate method is used internally by the conjugate operation, demonstrating its importance in creating various transformations for diagrams.

**Output Example**: The output will be a new `Diagram` object where each layer has been rotated according to the specified direction (`left`). For example, if you have a diagram with layers `[Box('f', Ty(), x), Box('g', Ty(), y)]`, and you call `.rotate(left=True)`, it would result in a new diagram with the same layers but rotated from the left.

### FunctionDef transpose_box(self, i, j, left)
**transpose_box**: The function of `transpose_box` is to transpose a specific box within a diagram at a given vertical index.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: i - The vertical index of the box to transpose.
· parameter2: j - The horizontal index of the box to transpose, only needed if the layer `i` has more than one box. Default value is 0.
· parameter3: left - Whether to transpose left or right. Default value is False.

**Code Description**: 
The function `transpose_box` transposes a specific box within a diagram based on the provided indices and direction. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

1. **Box Selection**: The function first selects the box at index `i` from the inside attribute of the diagram using `list(self.inside[i])[2 * j + 1]`. This step ensures that we are working with the correct box, taking into account any multiple boxes in a single layer.

2. **Transpose Operation**: Depending on the value of the `left` parameter, it either transposes the selected box to the left using `box.r.transpose(left)` or to the right using `box.l.transpose(left)`. This operation modifies the internal structure of the box according to the specified direction.

3. **Layer Division**: The diagram is then divided into two parts: one before index `i` (`top`) and another after index `i + 1` (`bottom`). This step ensures that the transposed box is isolated from its original position in the diagram.

4. **Box Extraction for Layers**: The function extracts the boxes and their corresponding types on either side of the selected box using slicing operations: 
   - `left_boxes_and_types = list(self.inside[i])[:2 * j + 1]` captures the left part.
   - `right_boxes_and_types = list(self.inside[i])[2 * j + 2:]` captures the right part.

5. **Layer Construction**: Two new layers are constructed using these extracted boxes and their types, ensuring that the correct order is maintained:
   - `left_layer = self.id().tensor(*(x if k % 2 else self.id(x) for k, x in enumerate(xs)))` constructs a layer from the left part.
   - `right_layer = self.id().tensor(*(x if k % 2 else self.id(x) for k, x in enumerate(xs)))` constructs a layer from the right part.

6. **Diagram Construction**: Finally, these layers are combined with the transposed box to form a new diagram: 
   - `top >> left_layer @ transposed_box @ right_layer >> bottom` concatenates the top part of the original diagram, the modified left and right layers, and the transposed box, followed by the bottom part.

**Note**: The function assumes that the indices provided are valid for the current structure of the diagram. Incorrect indices can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: 
Given a diagram `d` with boxes arranged in multiple layers, calling `transpose_box(0, 0, left=True)` would transpose the box at layer index 0 and position 0 (the first box) to its left. The resulting diagram will have this specific box moved while maintaining the overall structure of the diagram.

#### FunctionDef follow_wire(diagram, i, j)
**follow_wire**: The function of follow_wire is to trace the path of a wire through a diagram from one box to another.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `diagram` - A Diagram object representing the quantum circuit or diagram.
· parameter2: `i` - The index of the current box that we are inspecting.
· parameter3: `j` - The offset of an output wire at its bottom end, which helps in identifying specific wires within a box.

**Code Description**: 
The function `follow_wire` is designed to trace the path of a wire through a diagram by iterating from one box to another. It maintains two lists, `left_obstruction` and `right_obstruction`, to record any boxes that obstruct the wire's path on either side. The function checks if the current box takes the wire as input or if it is connected to the bottom boundary of the diagram.

1. **Initialization**: Two empty lists, `left_obstruction` and `right_obstruction`, are initialized to keep track of obstructions.
2. **Loop through boxes**: A while loop runs from index `i` until the end of the diagram minus one (since we do not check the last box).
3. **Update indices and offsets**: For each box, the function updates the index `i` and the offset `j`. If the current box's output wire matches the target offset `j`, it returns the current position `(i, j)` along with the recorded obstructions.
4. **Adjustment for left obstruction**: If the current box’s output starts before or at the target offset `j`, it adjusts the offset `j` to account for the difference in codomain and domain lengths and records the current box as a left obstruction.
5. **Record right obstruction**: Otherwise, the current box is recorded as a right obstruction.
6. **Return bottom boundary connection**: If no matching input wire is found within the diagram, it returns the index of the last box `len(diagram)`, along with the final offset `j` and the recorded obstructions.

**Note**: This function plays a crucial role in identifying yankable pairs by tracing wires through the diagram. It is called from the `find_snake` function to determine if there are any boxes that can be removed or "snaked" out of the diagram without breaking the circuit's integrity.

**Output Example**: 
For example, given a Diagram with three boxes and an initial offset `j = 1`, calling `follow_wire(diagram, 0, 1)` might return `(2, 3, ([], [1]))` if the wire from box 0 to box 2 at offset 1 is valid. Here, the left obstruction list is empty (`[]`), and the right obstruction list contains index 1 because it obstructs the path between boxes 0 and 2.

#### FunctionDef unsnake(diagram, cup, cap, obstructions, left_snake)
**unsnake**: The function of unsnake is to remove a snake from a given diagram by rearranging boxes using interchange operations.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `diagram` - A Diagram object representing the original quantum circuit or diagram where the snake needs to be removed.
· parameter2: `cup` - An integer index specifying one of the indices for a cup and cap pair in the diagram.
· parameter3: `cap` - An integer index specifying the other index for a cup and cap pair in the diagram.
· parameter4: `obstructions` - A tuple containing two lists, where the first list represents obstructions on the left side (relative to the direction of the snake) and the second list represents obstructions on the right side.
· parameter5: `left_snake` (optional, default is False) - A boolean indicating whether the snake being removed is a left snake or not. If True, it handles a left snake; if False, it handles a right snake.

**Code Description**: The function `unsnake` processes the given diagram by removing a specified type of snake (left or right). It uses interchange operations to rearrange boxes in the diagram according to the provided obstructions and indices. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by unpacking the `obstructions` tuple into two lists: `left_obstruction` and `right_obstruction`.

2. **Left Snake Handling**:
   - If `left_snake` is True, it iterates through each box in `left_obstruction`, performing an interchange between the current box and `cap`.
   - After each interchange, a new diagram state is yielded.
   - For each right obstruction index less than the current left box index, increment its value by 1 to adjust for the shift caused by the interchange.
   - The `cap` index is incremented after each operation.

3. **Right Snake Handling**:
   - If `left_snake` is False (default), it handles a right snake in a similar manner but in reverse order.
   - It iterates through `left_obstruction` in reverse, performing an interchange between the current box and `cup`.
   - After each interchange, the corresponding index adjustments are made to the `right_obstruction` list by decrementing them if they are greater than the current left box index.
   - The `cup` index is decremented after each operation.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Once all necessary interchanges have been performed, it constructs a new diagram without the snake using the adjusted indices from `cap` to `cup + 1`.
   - This final state of the diagram is yielded and returned as part of the function's output.

5. **Yielding Diagrams**: The function yields intermediate states of the diagram after each interchange operation, allowing for step-by-step visualization or analysis of the snake removal process.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the provided indices (`cup` and `cap`) correctly correspond to a cup and cap pair in the diagram, as incorrect indices will lead to incorrect operations. Additionally, the obstructions lists must be valid and relevant to the type of snake being removed (left or right).

**Output Example**: The function returns a sequence of Diagram objects representing intermediate steps during the removal of the specified snake, culminating in the final state of the diagram without the snake. Each yielded object can be inspected to track how the diagram evolves step-by-step.

### FunctionDef normal_form(self)
**normal_form**: The function of `normal_form` is to normalize rigid categories according to Dunn and Vicary's definition 2.12.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: **params** - A dictionary containing optional parameters that can be passed to the normalization process.

**Code Description**:
The `normal_form` method in the `Diagram` class is responsible for normalizing diagrams, which are essentially categorical structures used in quantum computing and logic. This method leverages the superclass's implementation of `normal_form`, ensuring consistency across different diagram types within the rigid category framework. The normalization process involves transforming a given diagram into an equivalent form that adheres to specific rules defined by Dunn and Vicary.

The examples provided demonstrate how this method can be used in practice:
1. **Example 1**: Two diagrams, `double_snake` and `two_snakes`, are created using the identity morphism (`Id`) and transposition operations. Despite their appearances, these two diagrams are equivalent after normalization.
2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, but with an additional parameter `left=True` for the transpose operation, ensuring that the left and right sides of a tensor product are treated symmetrically.

The `normal_form` method is called by various test cases in the project, such as `test_Diagram_normal_form`, which verifies its correctness through assertions. These tests cover different scenarios to ensure that the normalization process works correctly for various diagram configurations.

**Note**: Ensure that the input diagrams are well-formed and connected before calling `normal_form`. The method will raise a `NotImplementedError` if the diagram is not properly connected, as shown in the test case with the Eckmann-Hilton diagram.

**Output Example**: The output of the `normal_form` method would be an equivalent normalized form of the input diagram. For instance, given the diagram `double_snake`, its normalization might result in a simplified or rearranged version that is mathematically equivalent but structured differently according to the rules defined by Dunn and Vicary.

### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a given dictionary.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: state - A dictionary containing the serialized state of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The `__setstate__` method in the `Box` class serves the purpose of restoring the state of an object when it is being unpickled. This method is called by Python's pickle module during deserialization to reconstruct the object from its stored state. The method checks if a key named '_z' exists in the provided dictionary (`state`). If found, it assigns the value associated with '_z' to the attribute `self.z` and then deletes that entry from the dictionary to avoid overwriting any other attributes that might have been added since the object was serialized.

Here is a detailed analysis:
1. **Backward Compatibility Check**: The method first checks if the key '_z' exists in the state dictionary using an `if` statement. This check ensures backward compatibility with previous versions of the code where the attribute `_z` may have had a different name or did not exist at all.
2. **Attribute Assignment and Cleanup**: If the key '_z' is found, its value is assigned to the `self.z` attribute using the assignment statement `self.z = state['_z']`. After setting this attribute, the entry for `_z` in the dictionary is deleted using `del state['_z']`, ensuring that no duplicate or unnecessary data remains.
3. **Superclass State Restoration**: Finally, the method calls the `__setstate__` method of the superclass (using `super().__setstate__(state)`). This allows any additional attributes or state necessary for the superclass to be set, ensuring a complete restoration of the object's state.

**Note**: When using this method, ensure that the dictionary passed contains all necessary information for fully reconstructing the object. Additionally, maintain backward compatibility by checking for deprecated keys and handling them appropriately as demonstrated in the code snippet.

***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of `__repr__` is to return a string representation of the Box instance.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `__repr__` method generates a human-readable string that represents the current state and properties of a `Box` instance. If the `is_dagger` attribute is set to `True`, it calls the `__repr__` method from the `closed.Box` class, which likely provides a standard representation for boxes in closed diagrams. Otherwise, it calls the same method but removes the last character (likely a closing parenthesis) and appends an additional string that includes the value of the `z` attribute if it is not empty.

The `__repr__` method plays a crucial role in debugging and inspecting objects. By providing a clear and informative representation, developers can quickly understand the state of a `Box` instance without needing to delve into its internal properties directly.

**Note**: Ensure that the `is_dagger`, `z`, and other attributes are correctly defined and accessible within the `Box` class for this method to function as intended. The `closed.Box.__repr__` method should also be properly implemented to provide meaningful string representations.

**Output Example**: For a `Box` instance with `is_dagger=True` and `z=42`, the output might look like:
```
dagger(Box('name', dom, cod), z=42)
```

For a `Box` instance without `is_dagger` set to `True` and `z=None`, it would be something like:
```
Box('name', dom, cod)
```

***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to return a unique hash value for an instance of Box.
**Parameters**:
· None

**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method returns a unique hash value based on the string representation (`repr`) of the object. This ensures that each distinct instance of the Box class has a different hash value, which is useful when using such instances in hash-based collections like sets or dictionaries.

In detail:
- The `hash()` function from Python's built-in functions is used to generate a unique integer based on the string representation of the current instance (`self`).
- The `repr(self)` call provides a string that uniquely identifies the object, which can include its attributes and state.
- This hash value helps in quickly identifying whether an object exists within certain data structures or sets.

**Note**: 
- Since the `__hash__` method is defined, instances of the Box class will be hashable. This means they can be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets.
- The uniqueness and consistency of this hash value are crucial for correct behavior when using these objects in collections.
- If you modify the state of a Box instance after it has been added to a collection, its hash value may change, potentially causing issues with existing references.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of Box is created with some attributes, such as `Box('input')`, the `__hash__` method will return a unique integer based on this representation. For example:
```
box = Box('input')
print(hash(box))  # Output: A specific integer (e.g., -1425638790)
```
***
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to modify the direction of the box by rotating it either left or right.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: left (bool) - If set to True, the rotation will be performed on the left side; otherwise, it will be performed on the right side.

**Code Description**: 
The `rotate` method in the `Box` class is responsible for rotating the box either to the left or to the right based on the value of the `left` parameter. The method first determines the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) by accessing the appropriate attribute based on the `left` flag. If `left` is True, it uses the 'l' attribute; otherwise, it uses the 'r' attribute. Next, it adjusts the value of the internal variable `z`, which likely represents a position or direction indicator for the box, by either decrementing (if rotating left) or incrementing (if rotating right) its value by 1. Finally, it returns a new instance of the `Box` class with updated domain and codomain, as well as other attributes such as data and is_dagger remaining unchanged.

This method is called by another class in the project, specifically from the `Box` class defined in the `pregroup.py` module within the `grammar` package. This indicates that the `rotate` functionality is used to manipulate the structure of boxes in pregroup diagrams, allowing for transformations on either side of the box.

**Note**: Ensure that when calling this method, you provide a valid `left` parameter (True or False) to specify the direction of rotation. Incorrect usage could result in an invalid diagram structure where domain and codomain relationships are not properly maintained.

**Output Example**: If we have a `Box` instance with `dom = 'A'`, `cod = 'B'`, and `z = 0`, calling `rotate(left=True)` would return a new `Box` instance with updated `dom` and `cod` attributes, such as `dom = 'B'` and `cod = 'A'`, while keeping other properties like the name and data unchanged. The internal variable `z` would be adjusted to `-1`.
***
### FunctionDef is_transpose(self)
**is_transpose**: This function checks whether the box is an odd rotation of a generator.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: self - An instance of the Box class.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_transpose` method evaluates whether the current `Box` object represents an odd rotation of a generator. It returns `True` if the box is not a dagger (i.e., `self.is_dagger` is `False`) and the value of `z` (which typically indicates the type or nature of the box) is odd (`bool(self.z % 2)` evaluates to `True` only when `self.z % 2` is non-zero).

This method plays a crucial role in determining the orientation or transformation properties of boxes within the rigid category. It helps in distinguishing between different types of transformations, such as even and odd rotations.

The `is_transpose` function is called by the `to_drawing` method to set the `is_transpose` attribute of the drawing object. This ensures that when a box is converted into a drawing representation, its transformation properties are accurately reflected.

**Note**: Ensure that `z` has an appropriate value before calling this method; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur due to incorrect evaluation of oddness.

**Output Example**: The output will be either `True` or `False`, depending on whether the box is an odd rotation of a generator. For example:
- If `self.z == 3` (an odd number), and `self.is_dagger == False`, then `is_transpose` returns `True`.
- If `self.z == 2` (an even number) or `self.is_dagger == True`, then `is_transpose` returns `False`.
***
### FunctionDef to_drawing(self)
**to_drawing**: The function of `to_drawing` is to convert the Box instance into a drawing representation while preserving its transformation properties.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - An instance of the Box class.

**Code Description**: 
The `to_drawing` method in the Box class is responsible for generating a visual representation of the box. It first calls the `to_drawing` method from the superclass using `super().to_drawing()`. This base method likely handles the initial setup and creation of the drawing object, which could include setting basic properties such as size or shape.

Next, it sets the `is_transpose` attribute of the result to match that of the current Box instance. The `is_transpose` attribute is determined by the `is_transpose` method, which checks whether the box represents an odd rotation of a generator. Specifically, `self.is_transpose` is set based on the evaluation of `not self.is_dagger and bool(self.z % 2)`.

This ensures that when the Box instance is converted to a drawing, its transformation properties are accurately reflected. The `is_transpose` attribute helps in distinguishing between different types of transformations, such as even and odd rotations, which can be crucial for visualizing categorical diagrams correctly.

**Note**: Ensure that `z` has an appropriate value before calling this method; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur due to incorrect evaluation of oddness. The `is_transpose` attribute should accurately reflect the transformation properties of the box for proper visualization.

**Output Example**: The output will be a drawing object with the `is_transpose` attribute set according to the Box instance's properties. For example:
- If `self.z == 3` (an odd number) and `self.is_dagger == False`, then `to_drawing` returns a drawing object where `result.is_transpose` is `True`.
- If `self.z == 2` (an even number) or `self.is_dagger == True`, then `to_drawing` returns a drawing object where `result.is_transpose` is `False`.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of `rotate` is to create a new Sum instance by rotating the terms within the current Sum instance.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: left (bool) - If True, rotate the terms on the left; otherwise, rotate them on the right.

**Code Description**: 
The `rotate` method in the `Sum` class of the `discopy.rigid` module is designed to modify the arrangement of terms within a formal sum. This operation can be performed either by rotating the terms on the left or the right side based on the value provided to the `left` parameter.

- If `left=True`, it constructs a new Sum instance where each term's left component (l) is used, resulting in a transformation that effectively rotates the terms around the domain of the original sum. The codomain and domain of the new Sum are updated accordingly to reflect this change.
- Conversely, if `left=False` (the default), the method constructs a new Sum instance using each term's right component (r). This operation similarly modifies the arrangement of the terms but focuses on their right components.

Both operations rely on the `sum_factory` method, which is responsible for creating a new Sum instance with updated parameters. The `terms`, `cod`, and `dom` attributes are used to determine how the terms should be rearranged based on the value of `left`.

**Note**: Ensure that the `left` parameter is correctly set according to whether you want to rotate the terms on the left or right side.

**Output Example**: 
If we have a Sum instance with terms `[t1, t2, t3]`, and we call `rotate(left=True)`, the output would be a new Sum instance where each term's left component is used. For example, if the original sum was represented as `Sum([t1.l, t2.l, t3.l], cod.l, dom.l)`, the rotated version would be `Sum([t1.l, t2.l, t3.l], cod.l, dom.l)` but with a different internal representation that reflects the rotation.

If we call `rotate(left=False)`, the output would similarly use each term's right component. For instance, if the original sum was represented as `Sum([t1.r, t2.r, t3.r], cod.r, dom.r)`, the rotated version would be `Sum([t1.r, t2.r, t3.r], cod.r, dom.r)` but with a different internal representation.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return a new Cup object with flipped left or right caps.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: left (bool) - If True, the left cap will be rotated; if False, the right cap will be rotated.

**Code Description**: This method `rotate` is designed to manipulate the orientation of a `Cup` object by flipping its left or right caps based on the value passed to the `left` parameter. Here's a detailed analysis:

- The function takes one parameter: `left`, which is a boolean indicating whether the rotation should be applied to the left cap (`True`) or the right cap (`False`).
- If `left` is set to `True`, the method returns a new `Cup` object where the left cap, represented by `self.left.l`, is flipped and connected to the right leg of the other cap (`self.right.l`). Conversely, if `left` is `False`, it returns a new `Cup` object with the right cap, `self.right.r`, flipped and connected to the left leg of the other cap (`self.left.r`).
- The method utilizes `self.cap_factory` to create this new configuration. This factory function likely handles the construction or transformation of caps in the `Cup` structure.

**Note**: Ensure that `left` is either `True` or `False`. Passing any other value will result in undefined behavior.
**Output Example**: If the current `Cup` object has a left cap connected to the right leg and a right cap connected to the left leg, calling `rotate(True)` would return a new `Cup` with the left cap flipped to connect to the right leg instead. Conversely, `rotate(False)` would flip the right cap to connect to the left leg.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to raise an error indicating that the dagger operation is not defined for rigid cups.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method within the `Cup` class checks whether a dagger operation can be applied to a rigid cup. Since the concept of a dagger in the context of rigid cups is ill-defined, this method raises an error using the `AxiomError` exception class provided by the `discopy.utils` module.

The specific error message states that "Rigid cups have no dagger, use pivotal instead." This indicates to developers that they should utilize a different type of cup (specifically, a `pivotal.Cup`) when performing operations involving the dagger concept. The method ensures that any attempt to apply the dagger operation on a rigid cup will result in an immediate error, preventing invalid operations and maintaining code integrity.

**Note**: Developers should ensure they use the correct type of cup based on their operational requirements. Misuse of the `dagger` method with rigid cups can lead to unexpected errors or incorrect behavior in the application. Always check the documentation for the appropriate class to perform dagger-related operations.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return a new Cap object with the left or right legs swapped based on the parameter.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: left (bool) - If True, swap the left legs; if False, swap the right legs.

**Code Description**: This function `rotate` within the `Cap` class allows for the manipulation of the Cap object by swapping its left or right legs. The operation is performed using a conditional statement that checks whether the `left` parameter is set to True. If it is, the function returns a new Cap object constructed with the left leg from `self.right.l` and the left leg from `self.left.l`. Conversely, if `left` is False, the function returns a new Cap object with the right legs swapped.

The method utilizes the `cup_factory` to create these new Cap instances. This factory method likely handles the construction of the Cap objects based on the provided legs, ensuring that the structure and functionality of the Cap are maintained while altering its orientation.

**Note**: Ensure that the `self.left.l`, `self.right.l`, `self.left.r`, and `self.right.r` attributes exist and are correctly defined within the class. Also, verify that the `cup_factory` method is properly implemented to handle these inputs.

**Output Example**: 
- If `rotate(True)` is called on a Cap instance with legs `(a, b)`, it will return a new Cap object with legs `(b, a)`.
- If `rotate(False)` is called, assuming the same initial conditions, it would return a new Cap object with legs `(a, b)` unchanged but potentially reoriented in another context.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to raise an error indicating that the concept of dagger does not apply to rigid caps.
**parameters**: This Function takes no parameters.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method is defined within the `Cap` class, which is a part of the `rigid.py` module in the `discopy` package. The purpose of this method is to handle an operation that is ill-defined for rigid caps, specifically the concept of a dagger.

When invoked, the `dagger` method raises an instance of `AxiomError`, a custom exception class defined elsewhere in the project. This error message informs developers and users that using the dagger operation on a rigid cap is not valid, and they should use a different type of cap instead—specifically, a `pivotal.Cap`.

The `dagger` method calls `raise AxiomError("Rigid caps have no dagger, use pivotal instead.")`, which explicitly states that rigid caps do not support the dagger operation. The error message directs users to use a `pivotal.Cap` for operations requiring a dagger.

**Note**: 
- Developers should be aware that attempting to call the `dagger` method on an instance of `Cap` will result in an `AxiomError`. This method is designed to prevent incorrect usage and guide developers towards using appropriate types of caps.
- The error handling implemented here ensures that the application can gracefully handle invalid operations, maintaining consistency and correctness within the domain models.
