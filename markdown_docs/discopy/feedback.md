## FunctionDef str_delayed(time_step)
**str_delayed**: The function of str_delayed is to format time steps into string representations based on their values.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: time_step (int): An integer representing the time step value.

**Code Description**: This function takes an integer `time_step` as input and returns a formatted string based on its value. If the `time_step` is less than or equal to 3, it appends `.d` repeated by the number of times specified by `time_step`. Otherwise, if `time_step` is greater than 3, it returns a string in the format ".delay(time_step)".

This function plays a crucial role in formatting time steps for various components within the project. Specifically:
- It is called by the `__str__` method of the `Ob` class to append a formatted string representation of the time step when converting an object to its string form.
- Similarly, it is used in the `to_drawing` method of the `Box` class to append the appropriate time step representation to the drawing name if applicable.

These usages ensure that the time step information is consistently and correctly represented across different parts of the project, such as when converting objects to strings or generating visual representations.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `time_step` is always an integer. If non-integer values are passed, this function may not behave as expected.
**Output Example**: 
- For a `time_step` of 2, the output would be `.d.d`.
- For a `time_step` of 5, the output would be `.delay(5)`.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, name, time_step, is_constant)
**__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize an instance of the `Ob` class.
· parameter1: name (str) - The name of the object being initialized.
· parameter2: time_step (int, optional) - The time step associated with the object. Default value is 0.
· parameter3: is_constant (bool, optional) - A boolean indicating whether the object's state is constant. Default value is True.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method of the `Ob` class performs several key operations to set up an instance:
1. **Type Validation and Constraints**:
   - It first calls `assert_isinstance(time_step, int)` to ensure that `time_step` is indeed an integer.
   - Similarly, it uses `assert_isinstance(is_constant, bool)` to validate that `is_constant` is a boolean value.

2. **Error Handling for Negative Time Steps**:
   - The method checks if `time_step < 0`. If this condition is true, it raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that negative time steps are not supported in the current implementation.

3. **Initialization of Attributes**:
   - After validation and error handling, the method initializes two attributes: `self.time_step` with the provided `time_step` value and `self.is_constant` with the provided `is_constant` value.
   - The line `super().__init__(name)` calls the `__init__` method of the superclass (if any), passing the `name` parameter. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is also executed.

4. **Inheritance Considerations**:
   - If the `Ob` class inherits from another class, the `super().__init__(name)` call will initialize attributes and perform operations defined in the superclass's `__init__` method. This step ensures that all necessary initializations are performed, maintaining the integrity of the object's state.

5. **Default Behavior**:
   - If no time step is provided (`time_step=0`), it initializes with a default value.
   - The `is_constant=True` by default implies that the object's state will not change unless explicitly modified.

**Note**: Ensure that all parameters are correctly validated and handled to avoid runtime errors. Pay special attention to the constraints on `time_step`, as negative values are not supported. Also, consider any potential interactions with the superclass during initialization.
***
### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to create a new feedback object that represents a delayed version of the original feedback object by a specified number of time steps.
**parameters**:
· n_steps: An integer representing the number of time steps to delay the feedback object. Default value is 1.

**Code Description**: 
The `delay` function in the `Ob` class returns a new `Ob` instance with the same name as the original, but with an updated time step that is incremented by `n_steps`. This function is particularly useful for modeling delays in systems where feedback signals are delayed. The function leverages the properties of the original object to construct this delay.

The `delay` method plays a crucial role in creating feedback loops and delay mechanisms within the system, allowing developers to simulate scenarios where there is a time lag between an input and its effect on the system. It also supports syntactic sugar through methods like `d`, which serves as a shorthand for calling `delay(1)`.

The `delay` function interacts with other parts of the project, such as in the `tail` method, which uses `delay(-1)` to create a delayed version of an object if it is not constant. Additionally, the `test_invalid_inputs` function includes tests that validate the behavior and constraints around using the `delay` method.

**Note**: Ensure that when calling the `delay` method on an object, you provide a non-negative integer for `n_steps`. Negative values or zero can lead to unexpected behaviors as per the implementation. Also, be mindful of the time complexity involved in creating new instances; this function should not be called excessively within tight loops.

**Output Example**: If `Ob('x').delay(3)` is called on an object named 'x' with a current time step of 2, the returned object will have a name 'x', a time step of 5 (2 + 3), and retain its original constant status.
***
### FunctionDef head(self)
**head**: The function of `head` is to return the `HeadOb` instance or `None` if it is delayed.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: self - An instance of the `HeadOb` class.

**Code Description**:
The `head` method in the `HeadOb` class serves as a syntactic sugar for returning either an instance of `HeadOb` or `None`, depending on whether the object is delayed. This method checks if the `time_step` attribute of the current object is zero. If it is, the method returns the current `HeadOb` instance; otherwise, it returns `None`.

The implementation uses a conditional expression to return either `self` (if not delayed) or `None`. The `self.time_step` attribute indicates whether the object has been delayed in time steps. This mechanism is likely used within a larger system where objects can be delayed over multiple time steps, and this method provides a convenient way to handle such cases.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `time_step` attribute accurately reflects the delay state of the object.
- The method `head` is designed for internal use within the `HeadOb` class hierarchy and should not be called externally unless necessary.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `HeadOb` has a `time_step` value of 0, calling `head` on that instance would return the same instance. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

```python
# Example usage:
head_ob_instance = HeadOb(arg=SomeOb(), time_step=0)
result = head_ob_instance.head  # result will be an instance of HeadOb

another_head_ob_instance = HeadOb(arg=SomeOb(), time_step=1)
result = another_head_ob_instance.head  # result will be None
```
***
### FunctionDef tail(self)

         print("Password updated successfully.")
     else:
         print("Failed to update password.")
     ```

4. **`resetPassword(email)`**
   - **Description:** Initiates a password reset process by sending a reset link to the specified email address.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `email`: A string representing the user's email address.

    print("Authentication failed.")

# Initiate a password reset process
if user_auth.resetPassword("user@example.com"):
    print("Reset link sent successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to send reset link.")
```

**Notes:**
- The `passwordHash` property is not directly accessible and should be handled securely.
- Ensure that all methods are called within the appropriate context (e.g., user session) to maintain security.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how the `UserAuthentication` class functions, ensuring that developers can effectively use it in their applications.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to revert an object to its initial state at time step zero.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are:
· self: An instance of the Ob class that needs to be reset.

**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method in the `Ob` class serves to return a new instance of `Ob` with the same name as the original object and a time step set to zero. This is useful for operations where an object's state needs to be rolled back to its initial conditions, often employed within the context of functors or similar transformations.

The method returns an `Ob` object initialized with the following attributes:
- `name`: The same name as the original object.
- `time_step=0`: Setting the time step to zero, indicating the initial state.
- `is_constant=self.is_constant`: Preserving whether the object is constant (a property inherited from the original object).

This method is typically used in scenarios where an object's state needs to be reset for re-evaluation or comparison with its initial conditions.

**Note**: Ensure that any changes made within the object do not affect the original instance, as this method returns a new `Ob` instance. This approach maintains immutability and allows for safe state resetting without altering existing objects.

**Output Example**: 
If an object `obj = Ob('example', time_step=5, is_constant=True)` is reset using `reset()`, it will produce a new `Ob` with the following attributes: `{'name': 'example', 'time_step': 0, 'is_constant': True}`.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to check if two instances of the Ob class are equal based on their attributes.
**parameters**: This Function takes one parameter:
· other: An instance of the Ob class that needs to be compared with the current instance.

**Code Description**: 
The `__eq__` method in the `Ob` class is designed to compare whether two objects of this class are considered equal. It does so by first calling the `__eq__` method from the superclass (using `super().__eq__(other)`). This ensures that any base-class equality logic is respected as well. Then, it checks if the following attributes match between the current instance and the other object:
1. The `time_step` attribute.
2. The `is_constant` attribute.

If both the superclass comparison and the specific attributes comparison return `True`, then the two instances are considered equal and the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all objects being compared are of the same class (Ob), as this method does not perform any type checking.
- The `time_step` and `is_constant` attributes must be defined in the `Ob` class for this comparison to work correctly.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming obj1 and obj2 are instances of Ob with identical time_step and is_constant values
result = obj1 == obj2  # result will be True

# If any attribute differs, e.g., if obj1.time_step != obj2.time_step
result = obj1 == obj2  # result will be False
```
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to return a unique hash value based on the attributes of the instance.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method is defined to ensure that instances of the `Ob` class are hashable. It returns a hash code for the object, which is computed based on three attributes: `self.name`, `self.time_step`, and `self.is_constant`. This ensures that if two objects have the same values for these attributes, they will produce the same hash value.
- The use of `hash((self.name, self.time_step, self.is_constant))` creates a tuple from these attributes and computes its hash. This approach guarantees that each unique combination of attribute values results in a different hash code, making instances distinguishable based on their state.

**Note**: 
- Since the `__hash__` method is defined, objects of class `Ob` can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.
- The attributes `name`, `time_step`, and `is_constant` must be immutable for consistent hashing. If these attributes change after an object has been hashed, it may lead to inconsistencies.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `Ob` is created with the attributes `name='example'`, `time_step=10`, and `is_constant=True`, then the `__hash__` method will return a hash value based on this specific combination. For example:
```python
ob_instance = Ob(name='example', time_step=10, is_constant=True)
print(hash(ob_instance))  # Output: A unique integer representing the hash of (name, time_step, is_constant)
```
Note that the exact output (the hash value) will vary depending on the actual implementation and state of the object.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of `__repr__` is to return a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate the object.
**Parameters**:
· self: An instance of the class `Ob`.

**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method provides a human-readable string representation of an `Ob` object. This string includes details such as the name, time step (if applicable), and whether the object is constant or not. The representation helps in debugging and understanding the state of the object at any given point.

1. **Time Step Handling**: 
   - If the `time_step` attribute exists and is not empty, it appends a formatted string `, time_step={self.time_step}` to the return value.
   - This allows tracking changes over different time steps in simulations or similar scenarios where an object's state evolves with time.

2. **Constant Check**:
   - If the `is_constant` attribute is `False`, it appends `, is_constant=False` to the string representation.
   - This indicates whether the object represents a constant value or not, which can be useful in understanding the nature of the data being handled.

3. **Factory Name Generation**:
   - The method uses `factory_name(type(self))` to get a string that describes the class of the object.
   - For example, if `Ob` is derived from a class named `MyClass`, it will return `"MyClass"` as part of the representation.

4. **Object Representation Construction**:
   - The final string combines the factory name with the object's name and additional details (if any), enclosed in parentheses.
   - This ensures that the string accurately reflects the object’s state, making it easier to reconstruct or understand its current configuration.

5. **Functional Perspective on Callers**:
   - This method is called implicitly when the object is printed or when `repr()` is used on the object.
   - It provides a clear and informative output for debugging purposes, helping developers quickly identify issues in complex codebases.

**Note**: Ensure that all attributes (`name`, `time_step`, `is_constant`) are properly defined and initialized before calling this method. The absence of these attributes could lead to errors or incomplete string representations.

**Output Example**: 
For an object `obj` with the following attribute values: `name='exampleOb'`, `time_step=10`, and `is_constant=True`, the output might be:
```
MyClass(name='exampleOb', time_step=10, is_constant=True)
```
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to convert an instance of the `Ob` class into a string representation that includes its time step information.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: self (Object): An instance of the `Ob` class.

**Code Description**: This method combines the string representations generated by both `super().__str__()` and `str_delayed(self.time_step)` to produce a comprehensive string output. Specifically, it first calls the `__str__` method from the superclass to get any base information about the object. Then, it appends the formatted time step representation using the `str_delayed` function.

The `str_delayed` function is crucial here as it handles the conversion of an integer `time_step` into a string format. If the `time_step` is 3 or less, it returns a string with `.d` repeated according to the `time_step` value. For values greater than 3, it returns a string in the format ".delay(time_step)". This ensures that time steps are consistently and correctly formatted when an instance of `Ob` is converted to a string.

This method plays a vital role in making the object's state easily readable by developers or users who need to understand the current state of the object. By including both base information from the superclass and specific time step details, it provides a comprehensive view that can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.time_step` is always an integer when this method is called. Passing non-integer values may lead to unexpected behavior in string formatting.

**Output Example**: 
- For an instance of `Ob` with `time_step` set to 2, the output would be something like "base_info.d.d" if `super().__str__()` returns "base_info".
- For an instance of `Ob` with `time_step` set to 5, the output would be "base_info.delay(5)" if `super().__str__()` returns "base_info".
***
### FunctionDef d(self)
**d**: The function of d is to create a new feedback object that represents a delayed version of the original feedback object by one time step.

**parameters**:
· self: A reference to the current instance of the Ob class.

**Code Description**: 
The `d` method in the `Ob` class acts as syntactic sugar for calling the `delay` method with a default delay of 1 time step. It returns a new `Ob` instance that is identical to the original object except for its time step, which is incremented by 1.

This function serves as a convenient shorthand for developers who frequently need to create delayed versions of feedback objects and prefer not to type out the full `delay(1)` method call every time. By providing this method, it simplifies the code and improves readability, especially in scenarios where multiple delays are required.

From a functional perspective, `d` is closely related to the `delay` method. The `delay` function can be called directly with any positive integer value for the number of time steps to delay, whereas `d` always applies a delay of 1 step. This relationship highlights that `d` is essentially a specialized version of `delay`, tailored specifically for a single-step delay.

**Note**: While `d` provides syntactic sugar and simplifies code, it is important to be aware that using it excessively can lead to less readable code if multiple delays are needed. Always consider the context and readability when deciding whether to use `d` or directly call `delay`.

**Output Example**: If `Ob('x').d()` is called on an object named 'x' with a current time step of 2, the returned object will have a name 'x', a time step of 3 (2 + 1), and retain its original constant status.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, arg, time_step)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of `HeadOb` with a given argument and time step.
**parameters**:
· arg: Ob - The input argument which should be an instance of `Ob`.
· time_step: int (default 0) - An integer representing the time step for the object.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in the `HeadOb` class is responsible for setting up a new instance when it is created. It performs several key tasks:

1. **Argument Validation**: The method first calls `assert_isinstance(arg, Ob)` to ensure that the provided argument `arg` is an instance of `Ob`. This check helps maintain type safety and prevents incorrect usage.

2. **Time Step Validation**: The time step is validated by ensuring it is a non-negative integer using `assert_isinstance(time_step, int)`. If the time step is less than 0, a `NotImplementedError` is raised, indicating that negative time steps are not supported in this context.

3. **Initialization of Attributes**:
   - The `time_step` attribute is set to the provided value.
   - The `is_constant` attribute remains unchanged as it was passed during initialization.

4. **Superclass Initialization**: After setting up its attributes, the method calls `super().__init__(name)`, which initializes the superclass with a name. This ensures that the object can be represented and used in a way consistent with its parent class.

5. **Return Statement**: The method does not return any value explicitly; it sets up the internal state of the `HeadOb` instance for further operations or use.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the argument passed to `__init__` is an instance of `Ob`, as this method relies on certain attributes and behaviors defined in `Ob`. If an incorrect type is provided, a `TypeError` will be raised. Additionally, negative time steps are not supported, so any attempt to initialize with a negative value will result in a `NotImplementedError`.

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to shift the time step of an object by a specified number of steps.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: n_steps=1 (default value)
**Code Description**: The `delay` method shifts the time step of the current object by the given number of steps, `n_steps`. It returns a new instance of the same class with the updated time step. This operation is useful for manipulating the timing of objects in feedback diagrams.
This method plays a crucial role in adjusting the temporal relationships between different parts of a feedback diagram. For example, when dealing with time-shifted signals or sequences, this function allows developers to easily manipulate the timing without altering the underlying structure of the object.

**Note**: Ensure that `n_steps` is an integer value representing the number of steps by which you want to shift the current time step. Negative values can be used to shift the time step backwards in time.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `HeadOb` has a time step of 3 and `delay(-2)` is called on it, the returned object will have a time step of 1.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to revert an instance of HeadOb back to its initial state.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters other than `self`.
**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method within the class `HeadOb` returns a new instance of `HeadOb`, which is essentially a copy of the current object in its original, unmodified state. The returned instance will have the same attributes as when it was first created, including the value of `self.arg`. This method effectively undoes any modifications or transformations that may have been applied to the HeadOb instance since its creation.

In terms of functionality and integration within the project:
- **Relationship with Callers**: The `reset` function is called by other classes such as `TailOb`, `Head`, and `Tail`. These classes inherit methods from `HeadOb`, including `delay` and `reset`. When a method or transformation is applied to one of these derived classes, calling the `reset` method ensures that the object reverts back to its initial state.
- **Usage Context**: This function is particularly useful in scenarios where an object needs to be restored to a known, safe state after performing operations. For example, if a diagram is modified and you want to revert it to its original form before any changes were made.

**Note**: Ensure that the `reset` method is called only when necessary to avoid unnecessary creation of new instances, which could impact performance.
**Output Example**: The output will be an instance of `HeadOb` with attributes identical to those at the time of object instantiation. For example, if `self.arg` was initially set to `x`, the reset function would return a HeadOb instance where `arg = x`.
***
### FunctionDef head(self)
**head**: The function of head is to return either None or the current state based on whether a time step has been defined.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `head` method checks if a `time_step` attribute exists within the object. If it does, the method returns the current state of the object (`self`). Otherwise, it returns `None`. This functionality is useful for determining whether certain operations or states have been initialized or not.

```python
def head(self):
    return None if self.time_step else self
```
- The condition `if self.time_step` checks whether the `time_step` attribute exists and is truthy. If it does, the method returns `self`, which represents the current state of the object.
- If `self.time_step` is falsy (i.e., `None` or evaluates to False), then the function returns `None`.

This method ensures that operations dependent on a defined time step can be properly handled and avoids potential errors by checking for the existence of the attribute before proceeding with further logic.

**Note**: Ensure that the `time_step` attribute is correctly initialized within the object. If it is not present, calling this method will return `None`, which should be accounted for in any subsequent code using the result.
**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `HeadOb` has a defined `time_step`, the output would be:

```python
instance = HeadOb(time_step=True)
print(instance.head())  # Output: <current state object>
```

Alternatively, if no `time_step` is defined:

```python
instance = HeadOb(time_step=False)
print(instance.head())  # Output: None
```
***
### FunctionDef tail(self)
**tail**: The function of tail is to return the previous time step if it exists; otherwise, it returns None.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self (required) - An instance of HeadOb.

**Code Description**: The `tail` method checks whether there is a preceding time step for the current object. If `self.time_step` is not empty or None, it returns the result of calling the `delay(-1)` method on the current object. This effectively shifts the time step back by one step, representing the previous state in the feedback diagram.

The `tail` method relies on the `delay` method to perform its operation. The `delay` method is defined within the same class and takes an optional parameter `n_steps`, which defaults to 1. When called with `-1`, it shifts the time step back by one, effectively returning the previous state of the object.

If `self.time_step` is empty or None, indicating that there is no preceding time step, the method returns None. This behavior ensures that the `tail` method does not produce an error when applied to objects without a preceding time step.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.time_step` is properly initialized and updated as needed for the correct functionality of the `tail` method. The `time_step` attribute should reflect the current position in the sequence or timeline of the object within the feedback diagram.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `HeadOb` has a time step of 3, calling `tail()` on it will return the previous state with a time step of 2. If the initial time step is 0 and there is no preceding state, calling `tail()` will return None.

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to shift the feedback type by `n_steps` time steps.
**parameters**: 
· n_steps: An integer indicating the number of time steps to delay the feedback type. Default value is 1.

**Code Description**: The `delay` method takes an optional parameter `n_steps`, which defaults to 1, and returns a new instance of the same type as the current object after delaying each component inside by `n_steps` time steps. This operation is applied recursively to all elements within the feedback type structure.

This function is crucial for manipulating temporal relationships in diagrams or types that represent feedback loops, where delays are common. For example, it can be used to model a system with delayed responses or to simulate the behavior of signals after passing through various components of a network.

The `delay` method is called by several other functions and classes within the project, such as the `Diagram.wait` function, which creates a feedback loop that waits for one time step. Additionally, it is used in the initialization of certain objects like `FollowedBy`, where delays are applied to both domain and codomain components.

**Note**: Ensure that `n_steps` is a non-negative integer; otherwise, the method will raise an error or unexpected behavior may occur. Also, be aware that delaying a feedback type can significantly alter its structure and temporal dynamics, so it should be used judiciously based on the specific requirements of your application.

**Output Example**: If you have a `Ty` instance representing a feedback type with multiple components inside, calling `.delay(2)` will return a new `Ty` instance where each component is delayed by 2 time steps. For example:

```python
x = Ty('x')
feedback_type = x >> (x @ x).feedback()
delayed_feedback_type = feedback_type.delay(2)
```

In this case, the output would be a new `Ty` object with all components inside delayed by 2 time steps compared to the original `feedback_type`.
***
### FunctionDef head(self)
**head**: The function of head is to return the head of a feedback type, which is derived from :class:`HeadOb`.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `head` method is designed to extract and return the head part of a feedback type. It iterates through each element in the `inside` attribute (which presumably contains multiple elements), checks if the element has a `head` attribute, and then collects these heads into a new instance of the same class.

- **Detailed Analysis**:
  - The method starts by calling itself with the same arguments (`type(self)(...)`).
  - It uses a generator expression `(x.head for x in self.inside if x.head)` to filter through all elements in `self.inside`. This expression checks each element `x` of `self.inside` and only includes its `head` attribute if it exists.
  - The filtered heads are then passed as arguments to the constructor of the same class (`type(self)`) to create a new instance with these heads.

**Note**: Ensure that all elements in `self.inside` have a `head` attribute before calling this method, otherwise, an error may occur. Also, be aware that if no elements in `self.inside` have a head, the returned object will not include any heads.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.inside` contains multiple elements and each of them has a `head`, the output could look something like this:
```python
# Assuming Ty is defined as follows:
class Ty:
    def __init__(self, *heads):
        self.head = heads[0] if heads else None

# Example usage:
ty_instance = Ty(Ty(head='A'), Ty(head='B'))
result = ty_instance.head()
print(result)  # Output: Ty(head='A')
```
In this example, `ty_instance` has two elements in its `inside` attribute, each with a `head`. The method returns a new instance of `Ty` containing the head of the first element.
***
### FunctionDef tail(self)
**tail**: The function of `tail` is to retrieve the tail part of each component within the feedback type.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The method `tail` processes an instance of the class `Ty`, which contains multiple components or elements. For each element in the `inside` attribute (which presumably holds a collection of objects), it checks if the object has a `tail` attribute. If present, this `tail` is collected and returned as part of the result. The method then returns a new instance of the same class `Ty`, constructed with these collected tails.
- **Detailed Analysis**:
  - The function operates on an instance of `Ty`.
  - It iterates over each element in the `inside` attribute, which should be a collection (like a list or tuple) of objects.
  - For each object within `inside`, it checks if the object has a `tail` attribute. If so, this `tail` is included in the result.
  - The method returns a new instance of `Ty` with the collected tails as its components.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all elements in the `inside` collection have a `tail` attribute; otherwise, an error might occur during execution.
- This function assumes that the `Ty` class and its instances are correctly defined to support this operation. Specifically, each element within `inside` must be an object that has a `tail` method or attribute.

**Output Example**: 
If the instance of `Ty` contains elements with tails `[1, 2, 3]`, then calling `tail()` will return a new instance of `Ty` constructed from these tails. For example, it might return something like:
```python
Ty([1, 2, 3])
```
This implies that the output is another instance of `Ty` where each element corresponds to one of the collected `tail` values.
***
## ClassDef Layer
**Layer**: The function of Layer is to encapsulate monoidal layers with additional delay functionality.
**Attributes**: 
· `n_steps`: An integer parameter specifying the number of time steps to delay.

**Code Description**: 
The `Layer` class extends from `monoidal.Layer` and introduces a method called `delay`. This method returns a new instance of `Layer`, where each box or type within the original layer is delayed by the specified number of time steps. The `delay` method is recursive, applying the delay operation to every element in the list of boxes or types that make up the layer.

The `Layer` class serves as an important building block for more complex diagrams, particularly those involving feedback mechanisms. It allows for the creation of layers where each box or type within the layer can be delayed by a certain number of time steps, which is crucial for modeling systems with temporal dynamics.

**Relationship with Callers**: 
- **Diagram Class**: The `Layer` class is used as part of the `Diagram` class's implementation. Specifically, it is referenced in the `layer_factory` attribute of the `Diagram` class, indicating that instances of `Layer` are created and managed within the context of a `Diagram`. This relationship is evident from the fact that methods like `delay` on `Diagram` operate by delegating to corresponding operations on its constituent layers.
- **Delay Method**: The `delay` method in `Layer` is called when creating delayed versions of diagrams. For example, in the given code snippet, it is used within a larger diagram creation process where multiple boxes and their associated delays are combined using various operations.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that the number of time steps specified (`n_steps`) is non-negative.
2. The `delay` method operates recursively on all elements within the layer, meaning that if a box contains other layers or types, those will also be delayed by the same number of time steps.
3. Be mindful of the potential for deep recursion when dealing with complex layers, as this can lead to performance issues.

**Output Example**: 
If you have a `Layer` instance containing two boxes and call its `delay(2)` method, it would return a new `Layer` where each box is delayed by 2 time steps. For example:
```python
original_layer = Layer([Box('f1', Ty(), Ty()), Box('f2', Ty(), Ty())])
new_layer = original_layer.delay(2)
```
The resulting `new_layer` would be a new instance of `Layer` with the same boxes but each delayed by 2 time steps.
### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to apply a time-shift operation on each box or type within the current Layer instance.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: n_steps (default value = 1)
    - Description: An integer indicating the number of steps by which the signal should be delayed. A positive value indicates a delay, while a negative value would imply an advance in time.

**Code Description**: 
The `delay` function processes each element within the `boxes_or_types` attribute of the current Layer instance. It applies a delay operation to every box or type contained therein by calling the `delay` method on each individual item and then constructs a new Layer instance from these delayed versions. This effectively shifts all signals represented by the boxes or types in the direction specified by `n_steps`.

**Note**: 
- The `boxes_or_types` attribute is assumed to contain either instances of boxes (representing operations) or types (representing data elements), depending on the context.
- The function ensures that the structure and relationships between different components within the Layer are preserved after applying delays.

**Output Example**: 
If you have a Layer instance with three boxes, say `box1`, `box2`, and `box3`, calling `delay(2)` would create a new Layer where each box is delayed by two steps. For example:
```python
new_layer = current_layer.delay(2)
```
The resulting `new_layer` will have the same structure as `current_layer`, but all operations within it will be shifted forward in time by two steps.

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to apply a time shift or step delay to each box within the feedback diagram.
**parameters**: 
· n_steps: An integer indicating the number of steps by which the boxes inside the diagram are delayed.

**Code Description**: This method `delay` modifies the current Diagram object by applying a delay effect to all its internal components. Specifically, it takes an input Diagram and delays each box within it by a specified number of time steps (`n_steps`). The delay operation is performed on both the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the Diagram, ensuring that the overall structure and relationships remain consistent.

1. **Domain and Codomain Delay**: 
   - `self.dom.delay(n_steps)`: This line delays the domain of the current Diagram by `n_steps`. The domain is a fundamental part of the Diagram’s structure, representing the input space.
   - `self.cod.delay(n_steps)`: Similarly, this line delays the codomain by `n_steps`, which represents the output space.

2. **Inside Delay**: 
   - `tuple(box.delay(n_steps) for box in self.inside)`: This comprehension iterates over each box inside the Diagram and applies the delay operation to it. The result is a tuple of delayed boxes, maintaining the original order within the Diagram.

3. **Return Value**:
   - A new Diagram object is created with the updated inside elements (now delayed), and the modified domain and codomain. The `_scan=False` parameter indicates that no scanning or specific optimization steps are performed during this operation.

4. **Type Casting**: 
   - `type(self)(inside, dom, cod, _scan=False)`: This line ensures that the new Diagram object is of the same type as the original one (`self`). It constructs a new Diagram with the updated inside elements and domain/codomain values.

**Note**: Ensure that `delay` is called appropriately based on the context of the diagram. Misapplication can lead to incorrect delays or inconsistent diagrams, particularly if the delay operation does not align with the intended use case.

**Output Example**: If you have a Diagram with three boxes inside it and call `delay(2)`, the resulting Diagram will have each box delayed by two steps, while its domain and codomain are also shifted accordingly. The new diagram structure would reflect these delays in all components.
***
### FunctionDef feedback(self, dom, cod, mem)
**feedback**: The function of `feedback` is to create a feedback loop within a diagram.
**parameters**:
· dom: Optional; specifies the domain type of the feedback loop.
· cod: Optional; specifies the codomain type of the feedback loop.
· mem: Optional; represents the memory stack used in recursive feedback operations.

**Code Description**: The `feedback` function is designed to facilitate the creation of a feedback mechanism within diagrams. It serves as syntactic sugar, providing a more readable and concise way to implement feedback loops compared to directly calling the underlying `feedback_factory`. 

The function checks if the provided memory stack (`mem`) is either not given or contains only one element. If so, it returns a new diagram created using the `feedback_factory` method, which constructs the feedback loop with the specified domain (`dom`), codomain (`cod`), and memory (`mem`). If there are multiple elements in the memory stack, the function recursively applies the `feedback` operation to all but the last element of `mem`, followed by another recursive call on the last element. This process ensures that each part of the diagram with a feedback loop is correctly constructed.

The relationship with its callers can be understood as follows:
- In the test case for `test_Diagram_repr`, the `feedback` function is used to create a complex diagram involving copying and delaying operations, demonstrating how it simplifies the construction of such diagrams.
- The `test_walk` and `test_fibonacci` functions utilize the `@Diagram.feedback` decorator, which internally calls this `feedback` method. These tests showcase scenarios where feedback loops are essential for generating stochastic or recursive behavior in diagrams.

**Note**: Ensure that when using `feedback`, you provide appropriate domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) types if they are not inferred from the context. The memory stack (`mem`) should be correctly initialized to reflect the structure of the feedback loop.

**Output Example**: Given a diagram with boxes and operations, the output would be another diagram where each specified part is wrapped in a feedback mechanism. For example, applying `feedback` to a sequence of operations might result in a new diagram where certain parts are recursively delayed or copied based on the provided memory stack.

***
### FunctionDef time_step(self)
**time_step**: The function of time_step is to retrieve or calculate the time step associated with a diagram if it represents a box.

**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Diagram class representing a diagram within the project.

**Code Description**: The `time_step` method checks whether the current diagram contains exactly one element and if this single element is indeed a box. If both conditions are met, it returns the time step associated with that box; otherwise, it raises a ValueError indicating that the diagram does not qualify as a box for which a time step can be defined.

Here's a detailed analysis of the code:
1. The method first checks if the length of the diagram (`len(self)`) is equal to 1. This ensures that there is exactly one element in the diagram.
2. It then verifies whether the entire diagram itself is equivalent to its single box element (`self != self.boxes[0]`). If this condition fails, it means the diagram contains more than just a single box or isn't structured as expected for a valid time step calculation.
3. If both checks pass, it returns the `time_step` attribute of the first (and only) box in the diagram (`self.boxes[0].time_step`).

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the diagram you are working with is correctly structured and represents a single box for which a time step can be defined.
- The method relies on the presence of `time_step` attributes within the boxes, so these must be properly implemented.

**Output Example**: If the diagram is a Box named 'f' and this box has a `time_step` attribute set to 42, then calling `time_step()` would return `42`. For any other structure or if the conditions are not met, it will raise a ValueError.
***
### FunctionDef head(self)
**head**: The function of head is to return a Head object.
**parameters**: This Function takes no parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `head` method serves as syntactic sugar, providing an easier and more readable way to create a `Head` object from the current `Diagram` instance. It essentially calls the constructor of the `Head` class with the current `Diagram` instance as its argument, allowing for a cleaner and more intuitive code structure.

In detail, when this method is invoked on a `Diagram` object, it triggers the creation of a new `Head` object that encapsulates the current diagram's state. This process ensures that any transformations or operations performed on the original `Diagram` can be easily referenced by creating a `Head` instance. The `Head` class likely contains methods and attributes specific to handling feedback diagrams in a way that is distinct from other types of boxes or bubbles.

The method `head` is called within various test functions, such as `test_walk`, `test_fibonacci`, and the main `test_fibonacci` function. In these tests, the `head` method is used to initialize `Head` objects that are then used in further operations involving `fby`, `wait`, and other diagram-related constructs.

For example, in the `test_walk` function:
```python
def walk(x):
    y = fby(zero.head(), plus.d(rand.d(), x))
    return (y, y)
```
Here, `zero.head()` creates a `Head` object representing an initial state (`zero`), and this head is then used in the `fby` operation to define a sequence of operations.

Similarly, in the main `test_fibonacci` function:
```python
@Diagram.feedback
@Diagram.from_callable(X.d, X @ X)
def fib(x):
    y = fby(zero.head(), plus.d(fby.d(one.head.d(), wait.d(x)), x))
    return (y, y)
```
The `zero.head()` and `one.head.d()` calls create `Head` objects representing the initial states in the Fibonacci sequence. These heads are then used to construct a feedback diagram that defines the recursive nature of the Fibonacci function.

**Note**: Ensure that any tests or operations involving head methods are thoroughly understood before implementing them, as they play crucial roles in defining and manipulating feedback diagrams.

**Output Example**: The method `head` returns an instance of the `Head` class. For example:
```python
head_diagram = diagram_instance.head()
```
This would create a new `Head` object named `head_diagram` that encapsulates the state of `diagram_instance`.
***
### FunctionDef tail(self)
**tail**: The function of `tail` is to return a `Tail` instance associated with the current `Diagram`.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: self - An instance of the `Diagram` class.
**Code Description**: 
The `tail` method acts as syntactic sugar, providing a convenient way to obtain a `Tail` object linked to the current `Diagram`. This method essentially creates and returns an instance of the `Tail` class, passing the current `Diagram` instance as an argument. The `Tail` class is derived from both `monoidal.Bubble` and `Box`, inheriting properties and methods from these classes.
The `tail` method initializes a new `Tail` object by calling its constructor with the current `Diagram` instance and an optional `time_step` parameter set to 0. This setup ensures that the `Tail` object correctly represents the tail of the feedback diagram, starting from the second time step while maintaining the identity on the empty type at the first step.
**Note**: The `tail` method is a convenience function designed to simplify access to the `Tail` class for developers working with `Diagram` objects. It encapsulates the process of creating and initializing a `Tail` object, making it easier to work with feedback diagrams in the context of the `discopy` library.
**Output Example**: The output of calling `tail()` on an instance of `Diagram` would be a new `Tail` object that is associated with that `Diagram`. For example:
```python
diagram_instance = Diagram()
tail_instance = diagram_instance.tail()
print(tail_instance)  # Output: Tail(Diagram())
```
This output demonstrates the creation and return of a `Tail` instance linked to the `Diagram` instance.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, name, dom, cod, time_step)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Box instance with its name, domain (dom), codomain (cod), time step, and additional parameters.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `name` - A string representing the name of the Box.
· parameter2: `dom` - An object representing the domain of the Box. This could be any type that is relevant to the context in which the Box is used.
· parameter3: `cod` - An object representing the codomain of the Box, similar to the domain but typically related to a different set of values or types.
· parameter4: `time_step` (default value: 0) - An integer indicating the time step associated with this Box. This can be used for temporal operations or simulations.
· parameter5: `**params` - Additional keyword arguments that can be passed to customize the Box further.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method is the constructor of the `Box` class, responsible for setting up a new instance of the Box with the provided parameters. It first initializes two internal attributes `_time_step` and `_params`. The `_time_step` stores the time step value passed to the constructor, while `_params` holds any additional keyword arguments that were not explicitly handled by other parameters. After initializing these attributes, it calls the `__init__` method of the superclass (presumably another class in the inheritance hierarchy) with the name, domain, codomain, and remaining parameters.

This initialization ensures that a Box instance is properly set up with all required information, allowing for further operations or transformations within the context of the larger system. The use of `**params` allows for flexible customization of the Box without hardcoding every possible parameter, making the class more adaptable to different scenarios.
***
### FunctionDef to_drawing(self)
**to_drawing**: The function of `to_drawing` is to append time step information to the drawing representation of a Box.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self (Box): A reference to the current instance of the Box class.

**Code Description**: This method extends the functionality of the base class's `to_drawing` method by appending additional information related to the time step. Specifically, if the `drawing_name` attribute of the `box` object within the result is not empty, it appends a formatted string representation of the time step using the `str_delayed(self.time_step)` function.

The `str_delayed` function formats the time step into a string based on its value:
- If the `time_step` is less than or equal to 3, it returns a string consisting of `.d` repeated by the number of times specified by `time_step`.
- Otherwise, if the `time_step` is greater than 3, it returns a string in the format ".delay(time_step)".

This ensures that time step information is consistently and correctly represented when generating visual or textual representations of Boxes. The method then returns the modified result object, which now includes the appended time step information.

**Note**: Ensure that `time_step` is always an integer to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: 
- For a Box instance with `self.time_step` set to 2, the output would be something like `<original_drawing_name>.d.d`.
- For a Box instance with `self.time_step` set to 5, the output would be something like `<original_drawing_name>.delay(5)`.
***
### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to shift the time step of a Box by a specified number of steps.
**parameters**: 
· n_steps: An integer indicating the number of time steps to be delayed (default value is 1).

**Code Description**: This method `delay` modifies the time step associated with a Box object. It takes an optional parameter `n_steps`, which specifies how many time steps the Box should be shifted forward in time. The method computes the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the Box after applying this delay, updates the time step accordingly, and then returns a new Box instance with these updated properties.

The method first calculates the delayed domain and codomain using `self.dom.delay(n_steps)` and `self.cod.delay(n_steps)`, respectively. This ensures that any sub-boxes within the domain or codomain are also appropriately delayed. It then increments the current time step by `n_steps`. Finally, it returns a new Box object with the updated name, domain, codomain, and time step.

This method is used in various scenarios where operations need to be delayed in a diagrammatic context. For instance, the `wait` method from Diagram uses this functionality to create a delay of one time step by calling `Box(self.dom, self.cod).delay(1)`.

**Note**: Ensure that `n_steps` is a non-negative integer as negative values could lead to incorrect behavior or errors in the diagram's logic. Also, be aware that the method does not modify the original Box object but returns a new instance with updated properties.

**Output Example**: If you have a Box named 'input' with domain `Ty('x')` and codomain `Ty('y')`, calling `input.delay(2)` would return a new Box with the same name, delay-adjusted domain and codomain (`Ty('x').delay(2)`, `Ty('y').delay(2)`), and an updated time step.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to revert a Box instance back to its initial state at time step zero.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters; it operates on the current instance of the Box class.
**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method in the `Box` class is designed to reset an instance of Box to its original state, specifically at a time step of zero. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Delay Operation**: The method first computes delayed versions of the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the current Box object using the expression `x.delay(-self.time_step)` for both `self.dom` and `self.cod`. This operation effectively shifts these values back by the time step stored in `self.time_step`, which is a negative value since we are moving backward in time.

2. **Reconstruction of the Box Instance**: After obtaining the delayed versions, the method creates a new instance of the same type as the current Box (`type(self)`), passing along the original name and any additional parameters stored in `_params`. The domain and codomain are set to their delayed versions, effectively resetting the Box's state.

3. **Return Value**: The newly constructed Box object is then returned by the method.
**Note**: It is important to ensure that `self.time_step` is correctly initialized before calling this method; otherwise, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
**Output Example**: If a Box instance was created with a domain and codomain at time step 3, calling `reset` would return a new Box instance where both the domain and codomain are shifted back by 3 time steps, effectively resetting them to their initial state.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the Box instance, including its time step information.
· parameter1: self (Box): An instance of the Box class.

**Code Description**: 
The `__str__` method in the `Box` class returns a string representation that includes both the base string representation of the object and an additional part representing the time step. This is achieved by concatenating the result of calling `super().__str__()` (which likely provides a basic string representation) with the output of `str_delayed(self.time_step)`.

The `str_delayed` function, called within `__str__`, handles formatting based on the value of `self.time_step`. If `time_step` is less than or equal to 3, it returns a string consisting of `.d` repeated according to the time step. For values greater than 3, it returns a string in the format ".delay(time_step)". This ensures that the time step information is appropriately formatted and appended to the base representation.

This method plays a crucial role in providing human-readable representations for Box instances. It is used by other classes like `Head`, `Tail`, and `Feedback` which inherit from `Box`. Specifically, these derived classes rely on `__str__` to generate consistent string representations that include time step information when necessary. For instance, the `Head` class directly inherits its `__str__` method from `Box`, ensuring that any Box-derived objects correctly display their time steps.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `time_step` is always an integer. If non-integer values are passed, this function may not behave as expected.
**Output Example**: 
- For a Box instance with `self.time_step = 2`, the output would be something like "base_representation.d.d".
- For a Box instance with `self.time_step = 4`, the output would be "base_representation.delay(4)".
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Box object that includes its time step if it exists.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters as it is called on an instance of the Box class.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method in the `Box` class serves to generate a human-readable string representation of the box. It checks whether the `time_step` attribute of the object exists and, if so, appends this information to the string returned by the superclass's `__repr__` method (excluding the last character which is typically a closing parenthesis). The modified string is then returned as the representation.
- **Detailed Analysis**:
  - The method begins by checking if the `time_step` attribute exists. This is done using an f-string that includes `self.time_step`, but only appends this information to the final string if `self.time_step` is not `None`.
  - If `time_step` does exist, it is formatted as a string with the key-value pair: `, time_step=<value>`. The `if self.time_step else ""` part ensures that this string is only added when `time_step` is present.
  - The method then calls `super().__repr__()`, which returns the standard string representation of the object, including its name and any other attributes it has. However, since we are appending additional information at the end, we take all but the last character (`[:-1]`) to ensure that our new information is not separated by an extra comma.
  - Finally, the method concatenates this modified version with `time_step` information (if applicable) and a closing parenthesis to form the complete string representation of the object.

**Note**: Ensure that the `time_step` attribute is properly defined and initialized in instances of the Box class. If it is not used elsewhere, consider removing or refactoring its usage to avoid unnecessary complexity.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of the `Box` class has a `time_step` of 5, the output might look like this: `Box(name='some_name', time_step=5)`. If no `time_step` is set, it would return something like `Box(name='some_name')`.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to check if two Box objects are equal based on their time_step attribute.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - The instance of the current class (Box) being compared.
· parameter2: other - The object that is being compared against the current instance.

**Code Description**: This method checks for equality between two Box instances. It first calls the superclass's __eq__ method to perform a basic comparison, ensuring that the objects are of the same type and have similar attributes. Then, it compares the time_step attribute of both Box instances to ensure they are equal.
```python
def __eq__(self, other):
    # First, check if 'other' is an instance of the same class as 'self'
    # If not, return False indicating that the objects are not equal
    # This step ensures that only comparable types are being compared
    if not isinstance(other, self.__class__):
        return False
    
    # Call the superclass's __eq__ method to perform a basic comparison
    # This is necessary to ensure that other attributes of Box instances are also checked for equality
    result = super().__eq__(other)
    
    # If the basic comparison returns True, then check if the time_step attribute is equal
    if result:
        return self.time_step == other.time_step
    
    # If the basic comparison returned False, no need to further compare time_step
    return result
```

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `time_step` is a properly defined and accessible attribute of the Box class.
- The method assumes that `super().__eq__()` correctly checks for equality based on other attributes beyond just `time_step`.
- This implementation ensures that only objects of the same type can be compared, which prevents errors when comparing different types.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming box1 and box2 are two Box instances with identical time_steps
box1 = Box(time_step=5)
box2 = Box(time_step=5)

# Both boxes will have a result of True when compared using __eq__
print(box1 == box2)  # Output: True

# If the time_steps differ, the comparison will return False
box3 = Box(time_step=6)
print(box1 == box3)  # Output: False
```
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to compute a hash value based on the super class's hash value and the time step attribute.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters other than `self`.
**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method in Python is used to generate a unique identifier for an object, which can be useful when the object needs to be stored in a set or used as a key in a dictionary. In this implementation of the `Box` class, the hash value is computed based on two components:
- The result of calling `super().__hash__()`: This ensures that any inherited attributes and their values are included in the hash calculation.
- The `time_step` attribute: This adds an additional layer of uniqueness to the object's hash by incorporating the time step at which this particular instance was created or modified.

By combining these two elements, the method aims to create a unique hash value for each instance of the `Box` class, ensuring that identical objects will have the same hash value while different instances will generally have distinct hash values.
**Note**: 
- The `time_step` attribute should be appropriately defined and set in the `Box` class or its subclasses. If it is not defined, a `TypeError` might occur during the hashing process.
- This implementation assumes that the `super().__hash__()` method returns a unique value for each instance of the parent class. If this assumption does not hold, the combined hash may not be as reliable.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of the `Box` class has a `time_step` value of 10 and its super class's hash is 2048, then the resulting hash would be calculated based on these values. For example:
```python
hash_value = hash((2048, 10))
```
The exact output will depend on how Python's `hash()` function interprets the input tuple.

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to apply a time delay to both the left and right parts of the current Swap object.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: n_steps (default value 1)
    - This integer specifies the number of steps by which the left and right parts are delayed.

**Code Description**: 
The `delay` function is designed to recursively apply a delay operation on both the left and right components of the current Swap object. Specifically, it creates a new Swap object where each component (left and right) undergoes a delay transformation. The delay transformation itself involves applying the same `delay` method to the corresponding parts of the left and right components.

The function takes one optional parameter:
- `n_steps`: An integer representing the number of steps by which the components should be delayed. By default, this value is set to 1 if not specified.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens when the `delay` method is called:
1. A new Swap object is created.
2. The left part of the current Swap object undergoes a delay transformation using the `delay(n_steps)` method.
3. Similarly, the right part of the current Swap object also undergoes a delay transformation using the same `delay(n_steps)` method.
4. These transformed components are then used to construct and return the new Swap object.

This recursive approach ensures that any nested structure within the Swap objects is also processed appropriately, maintaining the integrity of the overall structure after applying delays.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input value for `n_steps` is a non-negative integer as negative values or non-integer inputs may lead to unexpected behavior.
- The function assumes that both left and right parts are of the same type as the current Swap object, otherwise, an error might occur during the recursive calls.

**Output Example**: 
If you have a Swap object `swap` with components `left` and `right`, calling `delay(2)` on it would result in:
```python
new_swap = swap.delay(2)
```
The `new_swap` will be a new Swap object where both the left and right parts are delayed by 2 steps. For instance, if the original structure was:
- Left: A simple component.
- Right: Another complex Swap object with its own components.

After applying the delay, the resulting structure would have:
- Delayed Left: The same as delaying the original left component by 2 steps.
- Delayed Right: The result of recursively delaying all components within the original right Swap object by 2 steps.

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to create a new instance of the current class by applying a delay operation on the domain part of the existing instance.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: n_steps (default value 1) - An integer representing the number of steps to delay.

**Code Description**: This method `delay` takes an optional parameter `n_steps`, which defaults to 1. It returns a new instance of the same class as the current one, but with its domain part delayed by `n_steps`. The codomain length remains unchanged.
- **Line-by-Line Analysis**:
    - `def delay(self, n_steps=1):` defines the method `delay` that takes `self` (the current object) and an optional parameter `n_steps`, which is set to 1 by default.
    - `return type(self)(self.dom.delay(n_steps), len(self.cod))`: This line creates a new instance of the same class (`type(self)`). The domain part is obtained through `self.dom` and passed to the delay method with `n_steps`. The codomain length, retrieved via `len(self.cod)`, remains unchanged in the new instance.

**Note**: Ensure that the domain and codomain are correctly handled according to the specific requirements of your class. If the domain or codomain has any additional attributes or methods, they should be appropriately managed within this operation.

**Output Example**: Suppose you have an object `copy_instance` with a domain length of 3 and a codomain length of 2. After calling `delay(2)`, the new instance will have a domain length of 5 (since 3 + 2 = 5), while the codomain remains at 2.

Example:
```python
# Assuming copy_instance is an instance of Copy with domain length 3 and codomain length 2.
new_instance = copy_instance.delay(2)
print(new_instance.dom)  # Output: 5
print(len(new_instance.cod))  # Output: 2
```

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to apply a temporal shift to the codeword by a specified number of steps.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: n_steps (default value = 1)
    - Description: The number of time steps by which the codeword should be shifted. It defaults to 1, meaning that if no argument is provided, it will apply a single-step delay.

**Code Description**: 
The `delay` function in the `Merge/delay` class takes an integer `n_steps` as input and returns a new instance of the same type with the codeword's domain unchanged but its codeword modified to reflect a temporal shift. This is achieved by calling the `delay` method on the codeword, which internally handles the shifting logic, and setting the codomain length based on the original domain length.

1. **Type Checking**: The function first ensures that it returns an instance of the same type (`type(self)`), maintaining consistency with other methods.
2. **Codeword Delay Application**: It then applies the `delay` method to the current codeword, which shifts the codeword by `n_steps`. This is crucial for operations involving time-series data or any scenario where a delay needs to be introduced into the processing pipeline.
3. **Codomain Length Preservation**: The function sets the length of the new instance's codomain to match the original domain’s length (`len(self.dom)`), ensuring that the overall structure and dimensions remain consistent.

**Note**: Ensure that `n_steps` is a non-negative integer, as negative values would not make sense in this context. Also, be aware that the delay operation can significantly impact the timing of subsequent operations or computations involving time-series data.

**Output Example**: Suppose you have an instance representing a codeword with a domain length of 5 and apply `delay(3)` to it.
- The original codeword might look like `[a, b, c, d, e]`.
- After applying the delay, the new codeword would be shifted by three steps: `[e, a, b, c, d]`.

### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of delay is to add a specified number of time steps to a diagram or arrow.
**parameters**: 
· n_steps: An integer specifying the number of time steps to be added (default value is 1).

**Code Description**: This method `delay` is designed to incrementally shift diagrams or arrows by a certain number of time steps. It operates on instances of the class that inherit from `type(self)`, applying the delay operation recursively to both the argument (`self.arg`) and memory (`self.mem`). The function returns a new instance of the same type, ensuring that the structure and behavior of the original object are preserved while adding the specified number of time steps.

- **Operation on self.arg**: 
  - `self.arg.delay(n_steps)`: This part delays the argument by `n_steps`. If `self.arg` is another diagram or arrow, this function will apply the delay operation to it as well.
  
- **Operation on self.mem**:
  - `self.mem.delay(n_steps)`: Similarly, the memory component (`self.mem`) also undergoes a delay of `n_steps`.

By recursively applying the delay operation to both the argument and memory components, the method ensures that any sequence or composition of diagrams is correctly adjusted in time. This is crucial for maintaining temporal consistency across complex diagram compositions.

**Note**: Ensure that the objects passed to `self.arg` and `self.mem` are properly initialized and capable of handling delays. The function will raise an error if these components do not have a valid delay method, which should be handled appropriately by the calling code.

**Output Example**: If you call `delay(3)` on a diagram object that has a single argument and memory, it returns a new instance where both the argument and memory are delayed by 3 time steps. For example:
```python
new_diagram = original_diagram.delay(3)
```
This will create a new diagram with its argument and memory each shifted forward by 3 time steps.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Feedback object.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Feedback class.

**Code Description**: The `__repr__` method constructs a string that represents the current state of the `Feedback` object. It does this by first determining the module and class name of the object using `factory_name(self.__class__)`. Then, it concatenates these names with additional information such as the number of arrows in the feedback diagram (`len(self.dom)`), the domain of the feedback arrow (if it exists), and the codomain. This string representation is particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes.

The method also includes a call to `bubble.arg()` if the object has an associated bubble, ensuring that any relevant information from within the bubble is included in the output. If the bubble does not contain exactly one arrow, a `ValueError` will be raised, indicating that the bubble is in an invalid state. This error handling ensures that the representation only includes valid and meaningful data.

The `factory_name` function is called to generate a string describing the class of the object, which helps in identifying the specific type of feedback being represented. The resulting string provides a clear and concise overview of the Feedback object's current state, including its domain, codomain, and any relevant bubble information.

**Note**: Ensure that the `Feedback` object is properly initialized before calling `__repr__`, as it relies on the presence of valid domain and codomain values. Additionally, handle potential `ValueError` exceptions if the associated bubble does not contain exactly one arrow to maintain robustness in your application.

**Output Example**: A possible return value might look like:
```
"feedback.pregroup.Feedback(grammar.pregroup.Word('apple'), grammar.pregroup.Word('orange'), bubble=grammar.pregroup.Bubble(grammar.pregroup.Word('banana')))"
```

### FunctionDef __init__(self, arg, is_dagger, time_step)
# Documentation for `DatabaseManager`

## Overview

The `DatabaseManager` class is designed to facilitate database operations in our application. It provides methods for connecting to the database, executing queries, and managing transactions. This class ensures that all interactions with the database are handled efficiently and securely.

## Class Structure

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, db_config: dict):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of the DatabaseManager class.
        
        :param db_config: A dictionary containing configuration details for the database connection.
        """

        self.connection = None

    def connect(self) -> bool:
        """
        Establishes a connection to the database using the provided configuration.

    def disconnect(self):
        """
        Closes the current database connection.
        """
        pass  # Implementation details for closing the database connection.

    def execute_query(self, query: str) -> list:
        """
        Executes a SQL query and returns the result as a list of dictionaries.

        """
        pass  # Implementation details for executing queries.

    def execute_transaction(self, *queries: str) -> bool:
        """
        Executes multiple SQL queries as a single transaction.
        
        :param queries: Variable number of SQL queries to be executed within the transaction.
        :return: True if all queries are executed successfully, False otherwise.
        """
        pass  # Implementation details for executing transactions.

    def get_connection(self) -> object:
        """
        Returns the current database connection object.
        
        :return: The database connection object or None if no connection is established.
        """
        return self.connection
```

## Usage Example

```python
from config import db_config

db_manager = DatabaseManager(db_config)
if db_manager.connect():
    results = db_manager.execute_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = 1")
    print(results)
    
    transaction_results = db_manager.execute_transaction(
        "UPDATE users SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1",
        "INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, amount) VALUES (1, -100)"
    )
    if transaction_results:
        print("Transaction executed successfully.")
    else:
        print("Transaction failed.")

db_manager.disconnect()
```

## Notes

- The `DatabaseManager` class assumes that the database connection details are provided in a dictionary format as specified by the `db_config` parameter.
- Error handling is not included in this documentation but should be implemented to manage exceptions and ensure robustness.
- The actual implementation of methods such as `connect`, `disconnect`, `execute_query`, and `execute_transaction` will depend on the specific database being used (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and the underlying database driver.

## Dependencies

This class relies on a configuration dictionary that includes necessary connection parameters. It also depends on an appropriate database driver or ORM library to handle SQL queries and transactions.

By following this documentation, developers can effectively utilize the `DatabaseManager` class to manage database operations in their application.

### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the FollowedBy object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters as it operates on the instance variables of the class.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method in the `FollowedBy` class generates a string that represents the current state of the object. It constructs this string by including key attributes such as whether the object is a dagger, and its time step value (if applicable). Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **is_dagger**: The line `is_dagger = ", is_dagger=True" if self.is_dagger else ""` checks if the `FollowedBy` instance has the attribute `is_dagger`. If it does, it appends `, is_dagger=True` to the string; otherwise, it appends an empty string.
2. **time_step**: The line `time_step = f", time_step={self.time_step}" if self.time_step else ""` checks if the `FollowedBy` instance has a non-empty `time_step`. If it does, it appends `, time_step=<value>` to the string; otherwise, it appends an empty string.
3. **repr(self.arg)**: The method calls `repr()` on the argument of the `FollowedBy` object, which ensures that the argument itself is represented in a way that can be used for further operations or as a string.

The final string is constructed by combining these parts and wrapping them around the `FollowedBy` constructor call. This helps in debugging and understanding the state of the object at any given point.
**Note**: Ensure that all attributes (`is_dagger`, `time_step`) are properly defined within the class for this method to work correctly. Also, make sure that the `repr()` function is appropriately overridden or imported if necessary.
**Output Example**: For an instance with `arg` as "test", `is_dagger` as True, and `time_step` not set, the output might be: `FollowedBy(test, is_dagger=True)`. If `time_step` were set to 5, it would become: `FollowedBy(test, is_dagger=True, time_step=5)`.
***
### FunctionDef delay(self, n_steps)
**delay**: The function of `delay` is to shift the time step of an argument by a specified number of steps.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: n_steps (int) - The number of time steps to delay the argument, with a default value of 1.

**Code Description**: 
The `delay` method takes an integer `n_steps` as input and returns a new object of the same type. If the current object is not marked as dagger (`is_dagger`), it will use its codomain (`self.cod`). Otherwise, it uses its domain (`self.dom`). The returned object has the same `is_dagger` property but with an increased `time_step` by `n_steps`.

This method is critical for manipulating time steps in diagrammatic representations. It allows developers to shift the timing of boxes or diagrams without changing their structure.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `n_steps` is a non-negative integer; otherwise, it may lead to incorrect behavior.
- The `time_step` attribute should be updated correctly to reflect the new delay.

**Output Example**: If you have an object with `self.time_step = 2` and call `delay(3)`, the returned object will have `time_step = 5`.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to create a new instance of the current class with the same arguments but without applying any transformations.
**parameters**:
· self: An instance of the FollowedBy class from which the reset operation is performed.

**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method in the `FollowedBy` class is designed to recreate an instance of itself, effectively undoing any transformations or operations that have been applied. This method takes no explicit parameters other than `self`, and internally uses the constructor (`type(self)`) with the original arguments (`self.arg`) and the current state of whether the argument is a dagger operation (`self.is_dagger`). By returning this new instance, it ensures that any subsequent operations can start from an unmodified state.

**Note**: When calling the `reset` method, ensure that the object's internal state (such as `arg` and `is_dagger`) remains consistent to avoid unexpected behavior. The returned object will have the same structure but without any transformations applied, making it useful for resetting operations in a sequence or diagram.

**Output Example**: If you call `reset` on an instance of `FollowedBy` with arguments `(1, False)`, the output would be a new instance of `FollowedBy` created using these exact parameters. For example:
```python
original_instance = FollowedBy(1, False)
new_instance = original_instance.reset()
# new_instance is now an instance of FollowedBy initialized with (1, False)
```
