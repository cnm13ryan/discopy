## ClassDef MappingOrCallable
**MappingOrCallable**: The function of MappingOrCallable is to unify the handling of mappings and callables.
**Attributes**: 
· `mapping`: Stores either a mapping or a callable.

**Code Description**: 
The class `MappingOrCallable` serves as a utility for treating both mappings (like dictionaries) and callables (functions) in a unified manner. It provides methods to handle these objects seamlessly, ensuring that the user can work with them without worrying about their specific types.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**: The constructor `__init__` accepts an argument of type `MappingOrCallable[KT, VT]`. If the input is itself a `MappingOrCallable`, it recursively unwraps it until a non-`MappingOrCallable` object is found and assigns this to its internal `mapping` attribute. This ensures that all operations can be performed on the underlying mapping or callable.

2. **Boolean Evaluation (`__bool__` Method)**: The method `__bool__` returns `True` if the `mapping` has any items, otherwise `False`. This allows for checking whether a `MappingOrCallable` object is "truthy" based on its internal state.

3. **Length Calculation (`__len__` Method)**: The method `__len__` returns the length of the underlying mapping or callable's domain. If it’s a mapping, this corresponds to the number of key-value pairs; if it’s a callable, it might be interpreted differently depending on context.

4. **Iteration (`__iter__` Method)**: The method `__iter__` yields keys from the internal `mapping`. This allows for iteration over the keys of the underlying object.

5. **Indexing (`__getitem__` and `__setitem__` Methods)**: These methods handle both reading and writing to the underlying mapping or callable. If the `mapping` supports indexing, it directly accesses the value; otherwise, if it’s a callable, it calls it with the provided key.

6. **Equality Checking (`__eq__` Method)**: The method `__eq__` checks for equality between two objects of type `MappingOrCallable`. It compares their internal mappings or callables based on whether they are instances of each other and if so, checks their contents for equality.

7. **Representation (`__repr__` Method)**: The method `__repr__` returns a string representation of the object, which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.

8. **Composition (`then` Method)**: The method `then` composes the current mapping or callable with another one. If the other argument is a dictionary-like structure, it creates a new `MappingOrCallable` that first applies the current mapping and then uses the result as input to the other argument. If the other argument is a callable, it returns a new `MappingOrCallable` where each key's value is transformed by applying the given callable to the corresponding value in the current object.

**Note**: When using `MappingOrCallable`, ensure that the underlying mapping or callable can handle the operations you intend to perform (e.g., setting values with `__setitem__`). Also, be mindful of the potential performance implications when dealing with large mappings or callables.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example usage
f = MappingOrCallable(lambda x: x + 1)
g = MappingOrCallable({0: 1})
h = f.then(g)  # h is now {0: 2}
print(h[0])    # Output: 2
```
### FunctionDef __class_getitem__(_, args)
**__class_getitem__**: The function of __class_getitem__ is to create a new type based on the given types `source` and `target`.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: _, which is ignored as it is always passed as the first argument when this method is called.
· parameter2: args (tuple[type, type]), representing the source and target types for the mapping or callable.

**Code Description**: The __class_getitem__ method takes a tuple of two types, `source` and `target`, and returns a new class that represents a combination of a Mapping from `source` to `target` and a Callable that accepts an instance of `source` and returns an instance of `target`. This is useful for creating type annotations or constraints in functional programming contexts.

In detail:
- The method signature indicates it takes two types: the first one is the source (`source`) and the second one is the target (`target`).
- It unpacks these into `source` and `target`.
- Using these, it returns a new class that combines a Mapping type from `source` to `target` with a Callable that maps an instance of `source` to an instance of `target`.

This method allows for creating strongly typed mappings or callables in a generic way. It is often used in functional programming paradigms where operations between two types are defined.

**Note**: This method should be called using the syntax `MappingOrCallable[source, target]`, which will result in a new class that enforces this specific type relationship.

**Output Example**: If you call `MappingOrCallable[int, str]`, it would return a new class that represents a mapping from integers to strings and a callable that takes an integer and returns a string. This could be used in type annotations or as part of a generic function definition where the input and output types are fixed but need to be parameterized at runtime.
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self, mapping)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the instance attributes of the MappingOrCallable class.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: mapping (MappingOrCallable[KT, VT]): This parameter represents an input that can either be a dictionary-like object or another instance of the MappingOrCallable class. It should map keys of type KT to values of type VT.

**Code Description**: 
The __init__ method first checks if the provided `mapping` is an instance of MappingOrCallable using `isinstance`. If it is, the while loop continues to unwrap any nested instances until a non-MappingOrCallable object is found. This ensures that only the final mapping object (which could be a dictionary or other simple value) is assigned to the `self.mapping` attribute.

The purpose of this method is to handle inputs in a uniform manner, regardless of whether they are direct mappings or nested MappingOrCallable instances, ensuring that any nested structures are flattened before being stored. This allows for consistent and predictable behavior when accessing or using the mapping within the class instance.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `mapping` is either a dictionary-like object or an instance of MappingOrCallable; otherwise, the while loop will not terminate as expected. Also, be aware that this method modifies the input by repeatedly unwrapping nested instances, which could lead to performance issues with deeply nested structures.
***
### FunctionDef __bool__(self)
**__bool__**: The function of __bool__ is to return whether the MappingOrCallable instance has a non-empty mapping.

**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
- None

**Code Description**: 
The `__bool__` method is defined to implement the built-in bool() function for instances of the class MappingOrCallable. It checks if the internal `mapping` attribute is truthy, meaning it returns True if the mapping is non-empty or contains at least one key-value pair, and False otherwise.

```python
def __bool__(self) -> bool:
    return bool(self.mapping)
```
- The method uses Python's built-in `bool()` function to evaluate the truthiness of `self.mapping`.
- If `self.mapping` is a non-empty dictionary or any other collection with at least one element, it will return True.
- Otherwise, if `self.mapping` is empty (e.g., an empty dictionary), it returns False.

**Note**: Ensure that the `mapping` attribute is properly defined and initialized in instances of MappingOrCallable to avoid unexpected behavior. The mapping should be a collection like a dictionary or any other iterable object suitable for truth value testing.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.mapping` contains at least one key-value pair:
```
True
```

If `self.mapping` is empty:
```
False
```
***
### FunctionDef __len__(self)
**__len__**: The function of __len__ is to return the length of the mapping or callable object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__len__` method is defined within the `MappingOrCallable` class and serves to provide a consistent way for external code to determine the size (or number of items) in the underlying mapping. It achieves this by delegating the actual length calculation to the built-in `len()` function, which operates on the `mapping` attribute of the object.
- The method signature `def __len__(self) -> int:` indicates that it is a special method used for Python's built-in functions like `len()`, and it returns an integer value representing the length.
- The implementation simply calls `len(self.mapping)` to calculate the number of items in the mapping, which could be key-value pairs or other iterable elements depending on how `mapping` is defined.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `mapping` attribute contains a collection that supports the `len()` function. This typically means it should be an object like a dictionary, list, tuple, etc.
- The method assumes that the mapping has a well-defined length, which may not always be the case if the underlying structure does not support this operation.

**Output Example**: 
If the `mapping` attribute contains a dictionary with 5 key-value pairs, then calling `len()` on an instance of `MappingOrCallable` would return `5`. For example:
```python
instance = MappingOrCallable({1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e'})
print(len(instance))  # Output: 5
```
***
### FunctionDef __iter__(self)
**__iter__**: The function of __iter__ is to iterate over the keys in the mapping.
**Parameters**: 
· self: This parameter refers to the instance of MappingOrCallable.

**Code Description**:
The `__iter__` method is defined to provide an iterable sequence of the keys present in the internal dictionary (`mapping`). When this object is used in a context where iteration is expected (such as a for loop), Python will automatically call this method. 

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Return Type**: The function returns an `Iterable[KT]`, where `KT` stands for Key Type, indicating that the method yields keys of type `KT`.

2. **Implementation**:
    ```python
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterable[KT]:
        for key in self.mapping:
            yield key
    ```
   - The method starts by iterating over each key in the internal dictionary (`self.mapping`).
   - For each key, it uses a `yield` statement to produce the value. This is important because it makes the function a generator, allowing it to return an iterable without fully materializing the sequence of keys in memory.
   
3. **Generator Behavior**: By using `yield`, this method acts as a generator. It does not store all the keys in a list or any other collection; instead, it generates each key one at a time when iterated over. This can be much more memory efficient for large datasets.

4. **Usage Context**:
   - When you use an instance of `MappingOrCallable` in a `for` loop, Python will automatically invoke this method.
   - Example usage: 
     ```python
     for key in mapping_instance:
         print(key)
     ```
5. **Benefits**: This implementation ensures that the object can be used seamlessly with any context that requires an iterable (like loops or list comprehensions), making it more flexible and versatile.

**Note**: Ensure `mapping` is properly defined as a dictionary within the class to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef __getitem__(self, item)
**__getitem__**: The function of __getitem__ is to retrieve an item from either a mapping or a callable based on the type of the internal attribute `mapping`.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: item (KT): The key or argument used to access the value in the mapping or call the callable.

**Code Description**: This method checks if the internal attribute `mapping` has the `__getitem__` method. If it does, then it retrieves and returns the corresponding value for the given `item`. Otherwise, it treats `mapping` as a callable and calls it with `item` to return the result.

To provide more detail:
1. The function first checks if the attribute `mapping` has an `__getitem__` method using `hasattr(self.mapping, "__getitem__")`. This is a common way in Python to check for the presence of a specific method on an object.
2. If `mapping` supports indexing (i.e., it has the `__getitem__` method), then `self.mapping[item]` is used to retrieve the value corresponding to `item`.
3. If `mapping` does not support indexing, but can be called as a function (`callable(self.mapping)` returns True), then `self.mapping(item)` is invoked to get the result.

This design allows the class `MappingOrCallable` to handle both mapping and callable objects seamlessly by delegating the appropriate operation based on the type of `mapping`.

**Note**: When using this method, ensure that `self.mapping` is either a dictionary-like object or a callable function. Mixing these types without proper handling might lead to unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If `self.mapping` is a dictionary and `item` is 'key1', then the output would be the value associated with 'key1' in the dictionary. Alternatively, if `self.mapping` is a function and `item` is 42, then the output would be the result of calling `self.mapping(42)`.
***
### FunctionDef __setitem__(self, key, value)
**__setitem__**: The function of __setitem__ is to set the mapped value to a specified key.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: key (KT) - The key at which the value should be stored or updated.
· parameter2: value (VT) - The value corresponding to the given key.

**Code Description**: 
The `__setitem__` method in the `MappingOrCallable` class is designed to allow direct assignment of values to keys, similar to how dictionary items are set. This method enables users to update or add new key-value pairs directly via indexing syntax, making the class more intuitive and user-friendly.

Here’s a detailed analysis:
- The method takes two parameters: `key` (of type KT) and `value` (of type VT).
- It directly updates the internal mapping dictionary (`self.mapping`) by setting the provided `key` to the corresponding `value`.
- This allows for easy modification of the object's state based on key-value pairs, providing a flexible way to manipulate mappings.
- The method returns `None`, indicating that it does not return any value but performs an in-place update.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the provided keys are valid and match the expected type KT.
- Be aware that if the key already exists in the mapping, its associated value will be updated. If the key is new, a new key-value pair will be added to the mapping.
- This method ensures that any changes made through indexing are immediately reflected within the object's state.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to check if two instances of MappingOrCallable are equal based on their mapping attributes.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: other (Any) - An instance that needs to be compared with the current instance.

**Code Description**: 
The `__eq__` method compares two instances of the class `MappingOrCallable`. It performs a comparison based on the `mapping` attribute of both objects. The logic is as follows:
1. First, it checks if the other object (`other`) is an instance of `MappingOrCallable`. If not, it directly returns whether the `mapping` attributes are equal.
2. If `other` is indeed an instance of `MappingOrCallable`, it compares the `mapping` attribute of the current instance with that of `other`.

This method ensures that two instances of `MappingOrCallable` are considered equal only if their `mapping` attributes are identical, providing a clear and consistent way to check for equality.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that any external objects passed as `other` have an appropriate `mapping` attribute to avoid runtime errors.
- This method does not account for differences in other attributes of the class (such as callable behavior), only focusing on the `mapping`.

**Output Example**: 
If two instances of `MappingOrCallable` have identical mappings, `__eq__` will return `True`. For example:
```python
class_instance1 = MappingOrCallable({1: 'a', 2: 'b'})
class_instance2 = MappingOrCallable({1: 'a', 2: 'b'})
print(class_instance1 == class_instance2)  # Output: True

class_instance3 = MappingOrCallable({1: 'a', 2: 'c'})
print(class_instance1 == class_instance3)  # Output: False
```
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the MappingOrCallable object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method returns a string that represents the current state of the `MappingOrCallable` instance. Specifically, it calls Python's built-in `repr()` function on the `mapping` attribute of the class instance. The `repr()` function generates a string that would allow the object to be recreated using eval(), which is useful for debugging and logging purposes.
The method works as follows:
1. It accesses the `mapping` attribute of the current `MappingOrCallable` instance.
2. It passes this `mapping` to Python's built-in `repr()` function, which converts the mapping into a string representation that includes all its key-value pairs in a readable format.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `mapping` attribute is properly defined and contains valid data types before calling `__repr__`. If the `mapping` is not correctly formatted or does not exist, this method will still return something but it might not be meaningful.
- The returned string should be useful for debugging and should ideally allow reconstructing the object using eval().

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `MappingOrCallable` has a mapping like `{1: 'one', 2: 'two'}`, then calling `__repr__` on this instance might return something similar to:
```
MappingOrCallable({'1': 'one', '2': 'two'})
```
***
### FunctionDef then(self, other)
**then**: The function of then is to return the composition of two mappings or callables.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: other (MappingOrCallable[VT, V2T])
    - Description: This parameter represents another mapping or callable that will be composed with the current instance.

**Code Description**: 
The `then` method allows for the composition of a MappingOrCallable object with either another dictionary (`other`) or a callable. If `other` is not already an instance of Mapping, it first converts `other` to one using `MappingOrCallable(other)`. The method then checks if the current instance's mapping has an iterable attribute (`__iter__`). If so, it returns a new MappingOrCallable object where each key from the original mapping is mapped through the current instance and further processed by `other`, resulting in a new dictionary. Otherwise, it returns a lambda function that applies the composition directly to any given key.

1. **First Step**: The method first checks if `other` is already an instance of Mapping. If not, it converts `other` into a MappingOrCallable object.
2. **Second Step**: It then checks whether the current instance's mapping has the ability to iterate (i.e., it has the `__iter__` attribute). 
3. **Third Step**: If the mapping is iterable, it creates a new dictionary where each key from the original mapping is transformed through both the current instance and `other`. This transformation results in a new MappingOrCallable object.
4. **Fourth Step**: If the mapping is not iterable, it returns a lambda function that takes a key, applies the current instance's callable to it, and then passes the result to `other`.

**Note**: The method ensures that both mappings are compatible for composition by converting non-Mapping objects into MappingOrCallable instances.

**Output Example**: 
Given an example where `mapping = MappingOrCallable({1: 'a'})`:
- If `other = {'a': 1}`, the output will be `{1: 1}`.
- Similarly, if `other = len`, the output will also be `{1: 1}`, as applying `len` to `'a'` results in `1`.
***
## FunctionDef get_origin(typ)
**get_origin**: The function of get_origin is to retrieve the origin class of a parameterized generic type.
**parameters**: 
· typ: The type from which to extract the origin.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_origin` function serves as a utility for determining the base class or "origin" of a parameterized generic type. This is particularly useful in scenarios where types are created with generics, such as those found in Python's typing module (e.g., List, Tuple). The function utilizes the `__origin__` attribute if it exists; otherwise, it returns the original type itself.

In the context of this project, `get_origin` plays a crucial role in several modules. For instance:

- In `discopy/cat.py`, it is used to determine the origin type when dealing with functors and arrows, ensuring that operations are performed correctly based on the underlying generic structure.
- Similarly, within `discopy/python.py`, `is_tuple` leverages `get_origin` to check if a given type is a tuple or a parameterized version of a tuple.

The function's implementation is straightforward but essential for maintaining flexibility and clarity in handling various types throughout the project. By extracting the origin class, it enables developers to write more generic and reusable code that can work with different parameterizations without hardcoding specific types.

**Note**: Ensure that `__origin__` exists on the provided type; otherwise, the function will return the original type itself. This is important for backward compatibility and handling non-parameterized types correctly.

**Output Example**: 
For a given generic type like `List[int]`, `get_origin(List[int])` would return the base class `list`. For a simple type like `int`, it would simply return `int`.

This utility function ensures that the project can handle both parameterized and non-parameterized types seamlessly, providing a consistent interface for operations involving generics.

### FunctionDef __class_getitem__(_, attributes)
**__class_getitem__**: The function of __class_getitem__ is to create a subclass based on the attributes passed as parameters.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: _, which refers to the current class instance and is typically not used within this method.
· parameter2: attributes, which can be either a single attribute or a tuple of attributes.

**Code Description**: The __class_getitem__ method in NamedGeneric is designed to facilitate the creation of subclasses with specific type variables. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Type Checking and Conversion**: 
   - If `attributes` is not already a tuple, it converts `attributes` into a tuple.
   
2. **Base Class Initialization**:
   - It initializes a base class `G` by calling the `__class_getitem__` method on `Generic`, passing in type variables derived from `attributes`.

3. **Subclass Definition**:
   - A new subclass `Result` is defined, inheriting from `G`.
   - This subclass overrides its own `__class_getitem__` to handle further instantiation.

4. **Customization of Subclass**:
   - If the subclass already has a `__is_named_generic__` attribute (indicating it's a NamedGeneric), it uses the base class as the new parent.
   - The method ensures that any passed values are in tuple form and maps them to corresponding attributes.
   - It checks if the combination of `cls` and `values` is already cached. If not, it creates a new subclass `C` derived from the original origin type with the specified attributes.

5. **Dynamic Class Creation**:
   - A dynamic class `C` is created using inheritance from the original type.
   - The name of the new class is generated based on the attribute values.
   - Attributes are set on the new class, and it is cached for future use to avoid redundant subclass creation.

6. **Class Properties Setup**:
   - The resulting `Result` class has its __name__ and __qualname__ properties updated with a string representation of the attributes passed in.

7. **Attribute Inheritance**:
   - Attributes from the original class are copied over to the new `Result` subclass.
   
8. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, it returns the newly created `Result` subclass.

**Note**: 
- The method ensures that each combination of attributes is cached to avoid redundant subclass creation.
- It handles dynamic class creation and attribute assignment, making it flexible for creating subclasses with varying type variables.

**Output Example**: If `attributes = ('x', 'y')`, the output would be a new subclass where `x` and `y` are type variables, inheriting from the base class `G`. The name of this subclass might look like `NamedGeneric[<type('x'), type('y')>]`.
#### ClassDef Result
**Result**: The function of Result is to dynamically create subclasses based on the given attributes.
**attributes**: The attributes of this Class are:
· cls: The class itself, which is the base class for dynamic subclass creation.
· values: The values passed to `__class_getitem__` to define the new subclass.
**Code Description**: This class serves as a subclass of `G`, and it overrides the `__class_getitem__` method to dynamically create subclasses based on provided attributes. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Base Class Handling**:
   - The method first checks if the class has an attribute `__is_named_generic__`. If so, it sets `cls` to its base class.
   - It then ensures that `values` is a tuple, even if only one value is provided.

2. **Cache Management**:
   - A cache `_cache` maintained by `NamedGeneric` is used to store previously created subclasses based on their attributes.
   - If the current class and attribute values combination are not already cached, it proceeds to create a new subclass.

3. **Subclass Creation**:
   - The method determines the origin of the base class using `get_origin`.
   - A new subclass `C` is defined dynamically by inheriting from this origin.
   - The new subclass `C` is marked as having `__is_named_generic__ = True` to indicate it's a generic type.
   - To ensure proper pickling, the `__reduce__` method is overridden. This method returns a tuple that can be used to recreate the object during serialization.

4. **Class Metadata and Attributes**:
   - The new subclass `C` gets its module name from the origin class.
   - Its name is constructed by appending the attribute names in square brackets, e.g., `Result[attribute1, attribute2]`.
   - Attributes are set on the new subclass `C` using the provided values.

5. **Cache Update**:
   - The newly created subclass `C` is stored in the cache under the key of class and attribute values.
**Note**: Ensure that all dynamically created classes have unique names to avoid conflicts, especially when dealing with nested classes or when pickling these classes.
**Output Example**: If `Result` is used as follows:
```python
class Result(G):
    def __init__(self, value1, value2):
        self.value1 = value1
        self.value2 = value2

# Dynamically creating a subclass with specific attributes
SubResult = Result['value1', 'value2']
```
The `SubResult` class would be defined as:
```python
class SubResult(G):
    __is_named_generic__ = True
    def __init__(self, value1, value2):
        self.value1 = value1
        self.value2 = value2
    __module__ = 'G'
    __name__ = 'SubResult[value1, value2]'
```
##### FunctionDef __class_getitem__(cls, values)
**__class_getitem__**: The function of __class_getitem__ is to create parameterized generic types based on the attributes and values provided.
**parameters**: 
· cls: The class from which to derive the new parameterized type.
· values: The values or parameters used to instantiate the generic type.

**Code Description**: 
The `__class_getitem__` method in this implementation is designed to dynamically create subclasses of a given class, allowing for the creation of parameterized types. This is particularly useful in scenarios where generic classes need to be instantiated with specific values. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Checks and Type Handling**:
   - The method first checks if `cls` has an attribute `__is_named_generic__`. If it does, `cls` is set to its base class (`cls.__bases__[0]`). This ensures that the process starts from the base generic class.
   - Next, `values` are converted to a tuple if they are not already one. This standardizes the input format.

2. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - A caching mechanism is employed using `NamedGeneric._cache`. If `cls` is not in `_cache`, it is added with an empty dictionary `{cls_values: cls}`.
   - The method then checks if `values` are already present as a key in the cache for `cls`. If they are, the corresponding class `C` is returned from the cache. This optimization avoids redundant instantiation.

3. **Dynamic Class Creation**:
   - The origin of `cls` is retrieved using `get_origin(cls)`, which determines the base generic type.
   - A new subclass `C` is dynamically created based on this origin, inheriting its properties and adding necessary attributes.
   - The class name is constructed by appending the parameter names to the original class name. For example, if `cls` is named `MyGeneric` and parameters are `[x, y]`, the resulting class will be `MyGeneric[x, y]`.
   - Attributes from the original class `cls` corresponding to the provided values are set in the new class `C`.

4. **Pickling Support**:
   - The dynamically created class `C` includes a custom `__reduce__` method to support pickling. This ensures that instances of `C` can be serialized and deserialized correctly, maintaining their state.

5. **Cache Update**:
   - Finally, the newly created class `C` is stored in the cache under the key `cls` and `values`, ensuring future requests for the same parameters return the cached result quickly.

This implementation ensures that parameterized generic types can be efficiently created and reused, enhancing code modularity and reusability. The caching mechanism significantly improves performance by avoiding repeated instantiation of identical classes.

**Note**: Ensure that `__is_named_generic__` is correctly set on the class to indicate it should be treated as a generic type. Additionally, handle cases where the input values are not valid or do not match the expected attributes of the class.

**Output Example**: 
If `cls` is `MyGeneric` and `values` are `(x, y)`, the output would be a new class named `MyGeneric[x, y]` with attributes corresponding to `x` and `y`. This class can then be instantiated as needed.
###### ClassDef C
**C**: The function of C is to enable pickling of dynamically created nested classes.
**attributes**: There are no explicitly defined attributes or parameters in the class definition provided.

**Code Description**: 
The class `C` inherits from an unspecified base class `origin`. It sets a class attribute `__is_named_generic__` to `True`, indicating that this class is part of a generic type system. Additionally, it overrides the `__reduce__` method to facilitate pickling (the process of serializing and de-serializing Python object structures) for nested classes.

1. **Override of `__reduce__` Method**: The `__reduce__` method is overridden to handle custom pickling logic.
2. **Inheritance from Base Class**: It inherits from an unspecified class `origin`, which implies that the base class might provide some foundational functionality or behavior.
3. **Checking for Class Name Format**: Inside the `__reduce__` method, it checks if the class name is of a specific format (i.e., contains square brackets). This check suggests that the class names are generated in a way that includes type information within them.
4. **Adjusting Pickling Parameters**:
   - If the class name matches the specified format, it adjusts the arguments passed to `__reduce__` by replacing `origin` with the original class and adding additional data.
   - It also stores the values used for `__class_getitem__` in a dictionary named `"__class_getitem__values__"`. This is necessary because pickling needs this information to reconstruct the object correctly after deserialization.

**Note**: The code assumes that the square bracket format in class names (e.g., `*ClassName*[*type*]`) is used for type annotations or generic parameters. Ensure that any dynamically generated classes follow this naming convention for proper pickling behavior.

**Output Example**: When a nested class with a name like `Result[C]` is pickled and then unpickled, the exact structure and types are preserved, allowing for correct object reconstruction.
####### FunctionDef __reduce__(self)
**__reduce__**: The function of __reduce__ is to enable object serialization by providing information about how to reconstruct the object when it needs to be serialized or pickled.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters directly; instead, it relies on the `super().__reduce__()` method to provide initial data and then modifies it based on specific conditions.
**Code Description**: 
The code begins by calling `super().__reduce__()`, which is a common practice in Python for inheriting and extending object serialization functionality. The return value of this call is unpacked into three variables: `func`, `args`, and `data`. 

Next, the method checks if the class name (which can be accessed via `args[0].__name__`) contains square brackets `[` and `]`. This condition implies that the class has been parameterized using generics or similar syntax. If such a pattern is found, the method modifies the arguments (`args`) by removing the first element of `args` and prepends it with an additional argument `origin`. Additionally, it updates the data dictionary (`data`) to include `"__class_getitem__values__"` as a key with corresponding values.

Finally, the modified tuple `(func, args, data)` is returned. This return value provides all necessary information for reconstructing or deserializing the object later on.
**Note**: 
- Ensure that `origin` and `values` are defined in your class context before calling this method.
- The use of square brackets in the class name suggests a generic type, which needs to be handled appropriately during serialization and deserialization processes.

**Output Example**: Suppose we have a class hierarchy where `C` is parameterized as follows:
```python
class C(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T):
        self.value = value

# Serialization process
origin = C[int]
value = 42
c_instance = origin(value)
func, args, data = c_instance.__reduce__()
print(func, args, data) 
```
The output might look something like:
```python
(<class 'pickle.loads'>, (C,), {'__module__': '__main__', '__qualname__': 'C', '__class_getitem__values__': [int]})
```
This example shows that the `func` is a function for loading from pickle, `args` contains the class `C`, and `data` includes metadata such as module and qualname along with the values used in parameterization.

### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore an instance's state from a dictionary.
**Parameters**:
· state: The state dictionary containing the saved state information.

**Code Description**: 
The `__setstate__` method is used during object unpickling, allowing for custom restoration of an instance's state. When an object is serialized and then deserialized (unpickled), Python calls this method to set the state of the object based on the provided dictionary. In the given code:

- The first line checks if the key ` "__class_getitem__values__"` exists in the `state` dictionary.
- If it does, the method retrieves the class value associated with ` "__class_getitem__values__"`.
- It then assigns this new class to the instance's `__class__`, effectively changing the type of the current object to match the deserialized class.

This mechanism is particularly useful when dealing with generic classes or when you need to dynamically change the class type during unserialization. By setting the class in this way, the object can be restored to an appropriate subclass or a different class altogether, ensuring that the state matches the correct class definition at runtime.

**Note**: When using `__setstate__`, ensure that the dictionary passed contains valid and expected keys to avoid unexpected behavior. Additionally, make sure that any necessary initialization code is executed appropriately after setting the new class.
***
## FunctionDef product(xs, unit)
**product**: The function of product is to compute the left-folded product of an initial unit value with elements in a list.
**Parameters**: 
· xs: list - A list of values to be multiplied together.
· unit: Any (default 1) - An initial value that will be used as the starting point for the multiplication. This can be any type, but defaults to 1 if not specified.

**Code Description**: The `product` function recursively multiplies each element in the list `xs` with an accumulated product starting from the `unit` value. If the list is empty (`not xs`), it returns the initial unit value. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the tail of the list (`xs[1:]`) and the current accumulated product multiplied by the first element of the list (`unit * xs[0]`). This process continues until the entire list has been processed.

The function is used to calculate a cumulative product in a functional manner, which can be applied to various data types. For instance, it can be utilized for numerical lists, where the initial unit is 1 (commonly used for multiplication), or for other non-numeric types where an appropriate identity value needs to be defined.

In the context of the project, this function is called within `Tensor` initialization methods (`__init__` and `id`). Specifically, in these cases, it is used to recursively define the inside dimensions of a tensor by applying the product operation on the inside attributes of given domain and codomain dimensions. This ensures that the dimensionality is correctly propagated through the tensor structure.

**Note**: Ensure that the type of elements in `xs` supports multiplication with the `unit`. If `xs` contains non-numeric types, make sure to define an appropriate `unit`.

**Output Example**: 
For a list `[1, 2, 3]` and default unit `1`, the output will be `6` (since \(1 \times 1 \times 2 \times 3 = 6\)). If `xs` is empty, it returns the initial `unit` value. For a non-numeric list with a defined `unit` such as `[42]`, an appropriate type-specific behavior should be implemented to handle the multiplication operation.

## FunctionDef from_tree(tree)
**from_tree**: The function of from_tree is to decode a serialised DisCoPy object into its corresponding DisCoPy diagram.

**Parameters**:
· tree: The serialisation of a DisCoPy object.

**Code Description**: 
The `from_tree` function takes a dictionary representing the serialised form of a DisCoPy object and reconstructs it into an actual DisCoPy diagram. This is achieved by first extracting the factory name (which specifies the type of object to be created) from the input tree, then dynamically importing the corresponding module and class using Python's `getattr` function. The actual construction of the object is handled by calling the appropriate method on this imported class with the remaining parts of the tree as arguments.

The process involves parsing the factory name to identify the specific DisCoPy class or object type that should be instantiated, followed by recursively building up the structure based on the nested dictionary format used for serialisation. This ensures that complex composite objects like diagrams made up of multiple boxes can also be reconstructed accurately.

This function is called in various tests and utility functions throughout the project, such as `test_from_tree`, `test_deprecated_from_tree`, and `loads`. These tests help ensure that the deserialisation process works correctly for different types of DisCoPy objects. Additionally, it is used within the `loads` function to handle lists of serialised objects.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tree accurately represents a valid DisCoPy object; otherwise, the reconstruction may fail or produce unexpected results. Pay special attention to the structure and correctness of nested dictionaries, as they represent complex composite structures in the DisCoPy framework.

**Output Example**: The function returns an instance of the appropriate DisCoPy class based on the input tree. For example, given a serialised representation of a diagram consisting of two boxes `f` and `g`, it would return the equivalent DisCoPy Diagram object that represents the composition `f >> g[::-1]`.
## FunctionDef dumps(obj)
**dumps**: The function of `dumps` is to serialise a DisCoPy object as JSON.

· `obj`: The DisCoPy object to be serialised.
· `kwargs`: These are passed to `json.dumps` for customising the JSON output, such as indentation or separators.

**Code Description**: 
The `dumps` function takes a DisCoPy object and converts it into a JSON-compatible dictionary representation. This is achieved by calling the `to_tree` method on the input object, which transforms the object's structure and attributes into a dictionary format. The resulting dictionary then gets passed to `json.dumps`, allowing for easy serialisation of the object.

The `dumps` function ensures that all relevant information about the DisCoPy object is preserved during the conversion process. For instance, if the input object is a `Box` or an `Id`, its name, domain (`dom`), codomain (`cod`), and any additional data are included in the dictionary representation.

The use of `to_tree` within `dumps` ensures that even complex transformations represented by the DisCoPy objects can be accurately converted to JSON. This is particularly useful for storing or transmitting the structure and properties of these objects in a format that can be easily parsed or reconstructed.

**Reference Relationships**: 
- **Caller**: The `dumps` function is called directly by various parts of the project, such as within tests like `test_loads_dumps`. It serves as a utility function for serialising DisCoPy objects.
- **Callee**: The primary method called by `dumps` is `to_tree`, which converts the object's structure and attributes into a dictionary. This ensures that the entire object can be represented in a way compatible with JSON.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input object is a valid DisCoPy object (e.g., `Box`, `Id`). Passing an invalid type will result in unexpected behavior or errors during serialisation.

**Output Example**: Here is an example of how the output might look:
```python
from discopy.cat import Box, Id

f = Box('f', 'x', 'y', data=42)
print(dumps(f[::-1] >> Id('x'), indent=4))
# Output:
{
    "factory": "cat.Arrow",
    "inside": [
        {
            "factory": "cat.Box",
            "name": "f",
            "dom": {
                "factory": "cat.Ob",
                "name": "y"
            },
            "cod": {
                "factory": "cat.Ob",
                "name": "x"
            },
            "is_dagger": true,
            "data": 42
        }
    ],
    "dom": {
        "factory": "cat.Ob",
        "name": "y"
    },
    "cod": {
        "factory": "cat.Ob",
        "name": "x"
    }
}
```
## FunctionDef loads(raw)
**loads**: The function of loads is to deserialize a serialised DisCoPy object back into its corresponding DisCoPy diagram.
· parameter1: raw (str) - A string representation of a DisCoPy object that has been serialized using the `dumps` method.

**Code Description**: 
The `loads` function takes a JSON-encoded string `raw`, which represents a serialised version of a DisCoPy object, and reconstructs it into an actual DisCoPy diagram. The process involves several steps:

1. **JSON Parsing**: The input string `raw` is first parsed using the `json.loads` method to convert it from a JSON string into a Python dictionary.
2. **Handling Lists**: If the deserialized object is a list, the function recursively processes each element of the list by calling `from_tree` on each item. This ensures that all elements are correctly reconstructed as DisCoPy objects or diagrams.
3. **Single Object Reconstruction**: For single objects (not lists), the function calls `from_tree` to decode the dictionary into its corresponding DisCoPy object.

The `from_tree` function is crucial in this process, as it handles the actual deserialization of each part of the tree structure back into a DisCoPy object. This recursive approach ensures that even complex composite objects are correctly reconstructed based on their nested dictionary representation.

**Note**: The input string `raw` must accurately represent a valid DisCoPy object; otherwise, the reconstruction may fail or produce unexpected results. Pay special attention to the structure and correctness of nested dictionaries, as they represent complex composite structures in the DisCoPy framework.

**Output Example**: Given a serialised representation of a diagram consisting of two boxes `f` and `g`, the function would return the equivalent DisCoPy Diagram object that represents the composition `f >> g[::-1]`. For example:

```python
raw = '{"factory": "cat.Arrow", "inside": [{"factory": "cat.Box", "name": "f", "dom": {"factory": "cat.Ob", "name": "x"}, "cod": {"factory": "cat.Ob", "name": "y"}, "data": 42}, {"factory": "cat.Box", "name": "g", "dom": {"factory": "cat.Ob", "name": "y"}, "cod": {"factory": "cat.Ob", "name": "z"}, "data": 50}], "data": null}'
diagram = loads(raw)
```

In this example, `diagram` would be a DisCoPy Diagram object representing the composition of two boxes as described by the JSON string.
## FunctionDef rmap(func, data)
**rmap**: The function of `rmap` is to apply a given function recursively to all elements within nested data structures.

**Parameters**:
· `func`: A callable function that will be applied recursively to each element of the input data.
· `data`: The input data structure, which can be a mapping (dictionary) or an iterable (list, tuple, set).

**Code Description**: 
The `rmap` function is designed to apply a given function (`func`) recursively to all elements within nested data structures. It first checks if the input `data` is a mapping (dictionary). If it is, the function applies itself recursively to each value in the dictionary and constructs a new dictionary with the same keys but updated values. If the input `data` is an iterable (list, tuple, set), the function applies itself recursively to each element of the iterable and constructs a new iterable of the same type with the transformed elements. For non-iterable or non-mapping types, it simply calls `func(data)`.

This function is particularly useful for processing deeply nested data structures where operations need to be applied at every level. The `rmap` function ensures that the operation is performed correctly regardless of the depth and complexity of the input structure.

**Note**: Ensure that the provided function (`func`) can handle all types of elements within the nested data structure, including mappings and iterables, as well as non-iterable or non-mapping values. If `data` contains complex structures like nested dictionaries or sets with custom objects, make sure those objects are handled appropriately by the `func`.

**Output Example**: 
Given the input:
```python
data = {'A': [0, 1, 2], 'B': ({'C': 3, 'D': [4, 5, 6]}, {7, 8, 9})}
```
and a function `lambda x: x + 1`, the output will be:
```python
{'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': ({'C': 4, 'D': [5, 6, 7]}, {8, 9, 10})}
```
This demonstrates how `rmap` applies the function to every element within the nested structure.
## FunctionDef rsubs(data)
**rsubs**: The function of `rsubs` is to recursively substitute values within nested data structures.

**Parameters**:
· `data`: The input data structure, which can be a mapping (dictionary) or an iterable (list, tuple, set).
· `args`: A variable number of arguments representing key-value pairs for substitution. If the first argument in `args` is not iterable, it gets wrapped into a single-element tuple.

**Code Description**: 
The function `rsubs` performs recursive substitutions within nested data structures based on the provided key-value pairs from `args`. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initial Check and Preparation of Arguments**: The function first checks if the second argument (`args`) is an iterable but not a mapping (dictionary). If so, it wraps this single-element into a tuple to ensure consistent handling.

2. **Key-Value Pair Extraction**: It then extracts keys and values from `args` using `zip(*args)`.

3. **Recursive Application of Substitution**: The function applies the substitution recursively by using `rmap`. Specifically, it uses `lambdify(keys, x)(*values)` to create a lambda function that substitutes each key with its corresponding value in `x`, and then applies this lambda function to every element within the input data.

4. **Recursive Mapping (rmap)**: The core of the substitution is handled by `rmap`. This function ensures that the transformation is applied recursively, meaning it will traverse through all levels of nested data structures such as dictionaries or lists, applying the substituted values wherever applicable.

5. **Returning the Transformed Data**: Finally, the transformed data structure (which could be a dictionary, list, tuple, set, etc., depending on the input) is returned.

**Note**: The `rsubs` function leverages the `rmap` utility to ensure that substitutions are applied correctly through all levels of nested structures. It is particularly useful in scenarios where deep transformations need to be performed on complex data hierarchies.

**Output Example**: 
Given the input:
```python
data = {'A': [0, 1, 2], 'B': ({'C': 3, 'D': [4, 5, 6]}, 7)}
args = ('x', 10)
```
The output would be:
```python
{'A': [10, 10, 10], 'B': ({'C': 10, 'D': [10, 10, 10]}, 10)}
```

This example demonstrates how `rsubs` can replace all occurrences of the key `'x'` with the value `10`, effectively substituting values within nested dictionaries and lists.
## FunctionDef load_corpus(url)
**load_corpus**: The function of `load_corpus` is to download and extract a corpus from a specified URL.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: url (str) - A string representing the URL where the corpus is hosted.

**Code Description**: 
The `load_corpus` function is designed to facilitate the loading of corpora stored in ZIP files accessible via URLs. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **URL Retrieval and Download**:
   - The function uses Python’s `urllib.request.urlretrieve` method to download the file from the provided URL. This method returns a tuple containing the local filename where the content is saved and an HTTP message object, which we ignore here by not referencing it.

2. **ZIP File Handling**:
   - Once downloaded, the local file is opened as a ZIP archive using `zipfile.ZipFile`. The function reads the list of files within this archive to identify the first file in the list.
   
3. **Reading and Deserializing Content**:
   - The content of the first file in the ZIP archive is read and deserialized into a DisCoPy object or diagram by calling the `loads` function, which reconstructs the object from its serialized form.

The `load_corpus` function thus serves as an entry point for accessing corpora stored remotely. It leverages existing libraries (`urllib` and `zipfile`) to handle network requests and file operations, while relying on the `loads` function for deserialization of the retrieved content into DisCoPy objects.

**Note**: Ensure that the URL provided is valid and points to a ZIP archive containing the corpus data in a serialized format compatible with the `loads` function. Any issues with the URL or the structure of the downloaded file may result in errors during deserialization.

**Output Example**: 
If the first file in the ZIP archive contains a serialized DisCoPy diagram, the output would be an equivalent DisCoPy Diagram object. For instance:

```python
url = "http://example.com/corpus.zip"
corpus_diagram = load_corpus(url)
```

In this example, `corpus_diagram` will be a DisCoPy Diagram object representing the content of the first file in the downloaded ZIP archive.

// Track an escalation
cs.TrackEscalation("Technical support was unable to resolve the issue within 24 hours.");

// Close the request after resolution
cs.CloseRequest(true, "Issue resolved by replacing faulty component.");
```

#### Notes

- Ensure that all service requests are documented and tracked accurately for better management.
- The `ServiceStatus` enum should be defined in a separate file for clarity and consistency.

This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the `CustomerService` class and its usage within the application.

### FunctionDef method(self)
**method**: The function of method is to sequentially apply a binary operation defined by `binary_method` to each element in `others`, starting with `self`.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: self - The current instance of the class, serving as the initial operand for the binary operation.
· parameter2: *others - A variable number of additional operands that will be sequentially applied using the `binary_method`.
· parameter3: **params - Keyword arguments passed to `binary_method` to customize its behavior.

**Code Description**: The method takes an initial object `self`, a variable number of other objects in `others`, and keyword arguments in `params`. It iterates over each element in `others`, applying the binary operation defined by `binary_method` between the current result (initially set as `self`) and the next operand from `others`. The `**params` are used to pass any additional parameters required by `binary_method`.

The process continues until all elements in `others` have been processed, with each step updating the `result` variable. Finally, the method returns the accumulated result after processing all operands.

This design allows for flexible and extensible operations where different binary methods can be applied depending on the context or requirements.

**Note**: Ensure that `binary_method` is defined in a way that it accepts two operands (one of which may be the current result) and keyword arguments. The method assumes that `binary_method` returns an object that can be used as input for subsequent operations.

**Output Example**: If `self` is initially 1, `others` contains [2, 3], and `params` are {'key': 'value'}, the output might be:
```
6
``` 
assuming `binary_method(x, y, **kwargs)` performs addition (x + y) with some additional processing based on `kwargs`.

// Reset user password via email
await user.resetPassword("john.doe@example.com");
```

#### Notes

- Ensure that all user data is handled securely and in compliance with relevant privacy laws.
- The `passwordHash` field should never be accessed or modified directly. Use the provided methods for changing passwords.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `User` object, including its properties and methods, to help developers effectively manage user data within the application.
### FunctionDef method(self, n_steps)
**method**: The function of `method` is to recursively apply an induction step to the current instance over a specified number of steps.
**Parameters**:
· n_steps: An integer indicating the number of recursive steps to perform.

**Code Description**: 
The `method` function performs a series of recursive operations on its own instance. It first checks if the input parameter `n_steps` is an integer using `assert_isinstance`. If `n_steps` is less than zero, it raises a `ValueError`, ensuring that only non-negative integers are valid for this method. When `n_steps` equals zero, the function returns the current instance of itself (`self`). For any positive value of `n_steps`, the function calls `method` recursively with an induction step applied to the current instance and `n_steps - 1`. This process continues until `n_steps` reaches zero.

This method is likely part of a larger system where each call represents a step in some computational or logical sequence, possibly related to pattern matching or transformation within categorical algebra frameworks. The use of recursion indicates that it operates on the structure of objects and their transformations over multiple steps.

**Note**: Ensure that `induction_step` is defined elsewhere in your codebase and correctly handles the transformation required for each step. Also, be cautious with large values of `n_steps`, as this could lead to deep recursion and potential stack overflow errors.

**Output Example**: If the current instance has a method called `induction_step` that transforms it into another object, and `n_steps` is 3, the function will return the result after three recursive transformations. For example:
```python
class SomeClass:
    def induction_step(self):
        # Transformation logic here
        pass

# Assuming an instance of SomeClass named obj
result = obj.method(3)
```
The `result` would be the object obtained after applying the `induction_step` method three times to `obj`.
***
## FunctionDef pushout(left, right, left_boundary, right_boundary)
**pushout**: The function of pushout is to compute the pushout of two finite mappings using connected components.
**Parameters**:
· left: The size of the left set.
· right: The size of the right set.
· left_boundary: A collection representing the mapping from boundary elements to the left set.
· right_boundary: A collection representing the mapping from boundary elements to the right set.

**Code Description**: 
The pushout function computes the pushout of two finite mappings by utilizing connected components. It first checks if the lengths of `left_boundary` and `right_boundary` are equal, raising a ValueError if they are not. The function then initializes sets and dictionaries for tracking components and mapping within each set.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `components`, an empty set, is used to store unique connected components.
   - `left_pushout` and `right_pushout` are dictionaries that will map elements of the left and right sets, respectively, to their corresponding positions in the pushout diagram.

2. **Identifying Proper Elements**:
   - For the left set, it identifies proper elements (elements not in the boundary) by subtracting the boundary from the full set.
   - These proper elements are then mapped using a dictionary comprehension where each element is assigned an index based on its position in the sorted list of proper elements.

3. **Graph Construction and Component Identification**:
   - A graph is constructed with edges representing mappings from the left and right boundaries to "middle" nodes.
   - Connected components of this graph are identified, which represent how elements from both sets can be merged into a single set while preserving their structure.

4. **Mapping Components**:
   - For each connected component, it updates `left_pushout` and `right_pushout` dictionaries to reflect the mapping of these components in the pushout diagram.
   - Elements in the left boundary are mapped based on their position relative to proper elements, as are those in the right boundary.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing all boundaries, it identifies remaining elements (proper elements) in the right set and maps them similarly to `right_pushout`.

6. **Return Values**: 
   - The function returns two dictionaries: `left_pushout` and `right_pushout`, representing how elements from the left and right sets map into the pushout diagram.

**Note**: Ensure that the lengths of `left_boundary` and `right_boundary` are equal before calling this function to avoid a ValueError. This function is critical for constructing diagrams in hypergraph theory, specifically as part of the composition operation (`then`) within the Hypergraph class.

**Output Example**: 
For example, if `pushout(2, 3, [1], [0])` is called, it might return `({0: 0, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3})`, indicating how elements from the left and right sets are mapped into a single pushout diagram.
## ClassDef BinaryBoxConstructor

      - Object: `{token: String}`

#### Usage Example

```javascript
const userAuth = new UserAuthentication();

// Authenticating a user
const authResult = userAuth.authenticate("john_doe", "password123");
console.log(authResult); // { success: true, token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." }

// Refreshing the token before it expires
const newToken = userAuth.refreshToken();
console.log(newToken.token); // "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
```

#### Notes

- The `authenticate` method returns a token that is valid for 1 hour by default. Users should use the `refreshToken` method to extend their session before it expires.
- Ensure secure handling of tokens and sensitive information such as passwords.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage user authentication in your application using the `UserAuthentication` object.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, left, right)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the state of an instance of BinaryBoxConstructor by setting its attributes.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: left - This represents the left operand or input that will be used within the BinaryBoxConstructor.
· parameter2: right - This represents the right operand or input that will be used within the BinaryBoxConstructor.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that gets called when an instance of the class is created. In this context, it sets up the initial state for each BinaryBoxConstructor object by storing the provided left and right parameters into the self.left and self.right attributes respectively. This allows these values to be accessible throughout the instance's lifetime.

The use of `self` as a prefix in the attribute assignment ensures that these variables are associated with the specific instance of the class, allowing for unique state per instance if needed. This method is crucial for initializing any necessary data or configurations required by the BinaryBoxConstructor object before it can be used to perform its intended operations.

**Note**: Ensure that `left` and `right` parameters are correctly provided when creating an instance of BinaryBoxConstructor; otherwise, their values might not be set appropriately, leading to potential errors in subsequent method calls.
***
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a given dictionary.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: state (dict) - A dictionary containing the serialized state of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The method `__setstate__` is used during the process of restoring the state of an object when it is unpickled. This function checks if the key "_name" exists in the provided `state` dictionary. If it does, it updates `_name` with a formatted string that includes the type name and the left and right attributes based on whether the object is a dagger or not.

Here's a detailed analysis of the code:
1. **Condition Check**: The first line checks if the key "_name" exists in the `state` dictionary.
2. **Name Update**: If `_name` is found, it updates `_name` with a string that concatenates the type name (obtained using `type(self).__name__`) and additional information about the left and right attributes. The format of this string depends on whether the object has the attribute "_is_dagger" set to True or False.
3. **Super Call**: Finally, it calls the superclass's `__setstate__` method with the same `state` dictionary, ensuring that any other state information is also properly restored.

**Note**: Ensure that the `state` passed to this function during unpickling contains the necessary keys and values as expected by your object. Also, be aware of how changes in the internal structure or naming conventions of your class might affect this method's behavior.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of `__repr__` is to return a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate the object.
**parameters**: There are no parameters defined for this method.
**Code Description**: This method constructs and returns a string that represents the current state of the `BinaryBoxConstructor` instance. It uses the `factory_name` function to get the class name, followed by parentheses containing the representations of the left and right attributes.

The `factory_name` function is called with `type(self)` as an argument, which provides the full qualified name of the class (e.g., "discopy.utils.BinaryBoxConstructor"). The string returned from `factory_name` is then concatenated with formatted strings representing the `left` and `right` attributes using `repr`.

For example, if a `BinaryBoxConstructor` instance has `left` and `right` attributes set to instances of other classes, their `__repr__` representations will be included in the final string.

This method ensures that when an object is printed or converted to a string, it provides a clear and useful representation that can be used for debugging and logging purposes. Additionally, this string can potentially be used to recreate the object by evaluating the returned string.
**Note**: Ensure that `left` and `right` attributes are properly defined and their `__repr__` methods provide meaningful representations. This method is particularly useful in interactive sessions or logs where a clear representation of objects is needed.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `BinaryBoxConstructor` has `left` and `right` attributes set as follows:
```python
self.left = SomeOtherClass("left_value")
self.right = AnotherClass("right_value")
```
The output might look like this:
```
"BinaryBoxConstructor(SomeOtherClass('left_value'), AnotherClass('right_value'))"
```
***
### FunctionDef to_tree(self)
**to_tree**: The function of `to_tree` is to serialize a binary box constructor.
**Parameters**:
· self: An instance of the BinaryBoxConstructor class.

**Code Description**: 
The `to_tree` method serializes a binary box constructor by recursively converting its left and right components into dictionaries. This process involves creating a dictionary that represents the current object, with keys for the factory name (determined by `factory_name(type(self))`), and sub-dictionaries for the left and right children.

1. The method first calls `to_tree` on the `left` and `right` attributes of the current instance.
2. It then constructs a dictionary using the factory name, which is determined by calling `factory_name(type(self))`. This function returns a string that uniquely identifies the class type within the Discopy framework.
3. The resulting dictionary contains keys for 'left' and 'right', each pointing to the serialized forms of the left and right children.

This serialization process ensures that complex binary box constructors can be represented in a structured format, making it easier to store or transmit their representation.

**Reference Relationship with Callers and Callees**: 
The `to_tree` method is called by other parts of the Discopy framework when serializing diagrams. For example, in unit tests like `test_to_tree`, this method is used to ensure that binary box constructors can be accurately converted back into their original form using `from_tree`.

**Note**: Ensure that all components (left and right) are correctly serialized before constructing the final dictionary. Any issues with serialization at the component level may lead to errors in the final output.

**Output Example**: 
For a BinaryBoxConstructor instance representing "x >> y", the output might look like:
```python
{
    'factory': 'grammar.box.BinaryBoxConstructor',
    'left': {
        'factory': 'grammar.box.BA',
        'dom': {'name': 'x'},
        'codom': {'name': 'y'}
    },
    'right': None
}
```
This example assumes that the `BA` class is used for representing a box with input and output types. The `right` child would be `None` if it does not exist or is not relevant in this context.
***
### FunctionDef from_tree(cls, tree)
**from_tree**: The function of from_tree is to decode a serialised binary box constructor.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: tree (dict): A dictionary representing the structure of a binary box constructor that needs to be decoded.

**Code Description**: 
The `from_tree` method is responsible for reconstructing a BinaryBoxConstructor object based on a serialized representation stored in a dictionary. The input `tree` argument is expected to be a dictionary containing keys 'left' and 'right', which represent the left and right subtrees of the binary box constructor, respectively.

Here's a detailed analysis:
1. **Input Validation**: The function expects an input parameter named `tree`, which should be a dictionary.
2. **Recursive Decoding**: Inside the method, it uses `map` to apply the `from_tree` function recursively to the values associated with the 'left' and 'right' keys in the `tree` dictionary. This means that if these keys contain dictionaries themselves (representing further nested binary box constructors), they will be decoded into their corresponding BinaryBoxConstructor objects.
3. **Class Instantiation**: The method then instantiates a new instance of `cls` using the results from the recursive decoding, effectively building the full structure of the binary box constructor.

**Note**: Ensure that the input dictionary is correctly structured with 'left' and 'right' keys for proper decoding. Any missing or incorrectly formatted keys may result in errors during execution.

**Output Example**: 
If `tree` contains a dictionary like {'left': {'left': {}, 'right': {}}, 'right': {'left': {}, 'right': {}}}, the function will return a BinaryBoxConstructor object representing a binary tree with two leaves.
***
## FunctionDef draw_and_compare(file, folder, tol)
**draw_and_compare**: The function of draw_and_compare is to compare a generated diagram with a baseline image by drawing both images and checking their similarity.

**parameters**: 
· file: A string representing the name of the baseline image file.
· folder: A string indicating the directory where the baseline and test images are stored.
· tol: An integer or float specifying the tolerance level for comparing the two images.
· **params**: Additional keyword arguments that can include any parameters needed by the drawing function, such as 'draw' (which specifies how to draw the diagram).

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_and_compare` function is designed to test if a given diagram produced by some function matches an existing baseline image. It acts as a decorator that wraps around another function responsible for generating the diagram.

1. The outermost function, `draw_and_compare`, takes three required parameters: `file`, `folder`, and `tol`. These define the name of the baseline file, the directory path where images are stored, and the tolerance level used to compare the two images.
2. It also accepts additional keyword arguments in `params`, which can be used to customize the drawing process.
3. The function returns a decorator (`decorator`), which itself is another function that takes a diagram-generating function as an argument.
4. Inside the inner decorator, it first generates the diagram by calling the provided function.
5. It retrieves the drawing method from `params`, defaulting to the diagram's draw method if not specified.
6. The true and test images are saved in respective paths within the given folder.
7. The images are compared using a comparison function that returns `None` if they match within the specified tolerance; otherwise, it returns an error message.
8. If there is no error, the test image file is deleted to clean up.

**Note**: Ensure that the baseline and test images have the same dimensions and content for accurate comparisons. The `tol` parameter should be set appropriately based on the expected differences between the two images.

**Output Example**: 
The function does not return any value directly but throws an assertion error if the comparison fails, indicating a mismatch between the generated diagram and the baseline image. If everything is correct, no errors are thrown, and the test image is deleted from the directory.
### FunctionDef decorator(func)
**decorator**: The function of decorator is to wrap a function that returns a diagram and ensure its visual output matches expected results.

**parameters**: 
· func: This is the function that needs to be decorated, which should return a diagram.
· wrapper: This is an inner function that encapsulates the behavior of `func` and handles the comparison logic.

**Code Description**: The code defines a decorator named `decorator`. It takes a single parameter `func`, which is expected to return a diagram. The decorator returns another function, `wrapper`, which performs the following tasks:
1. Calls `func()` to obtain the diagram.
2. Retrieves the drawing method from the parameters; if not provided, it defaults to the draw method of the type of diagram returned by `func()`.
3. Constructs file paths for the true and test image comparisons.
4. Draws the diagram using the specified method and saves it to a temporary path.
5. Compares the saved image with the expected true image using a comparison function (not shown in this snippet).
6. Asserts that the comparison result is `None`, indicating successful matching of images.
7. Deletes the temporary test image file.

**Note**: Ensure that `params` and `compare_images` are defined elsewhere in your codebase, as they are used but not imported or defined here. Also, make sure the paths specified for true and test images exist and are correctly formatted.

**Output Example**: The decorator does not return a value; instead, it executes the comparison logic and asserts that the output image matches the expected one. If the assertion fails, an `AssertionError` will be raised.
#### FunctionDef wrapper
**wrapper**: The function of wrapper is to compare images generated from diagrams using a decorator pattern.

**parameters**: This Function does not explicitly define any parameters but relies on external context provided through the `func` and `params` variables, as well as the `folder` and `file` paths.

**Code Description**: 
The `wrapper` function acts as an intermediary that wraps around another function (`func`) to perform specific operations. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Initialization and Setup**: The function starts by invoking the `func()` function, which presumably returns a diagram object.
2. **Parameter Extraction**: It retrieves the value for 'draw' from the `params` dictionary. If 'draw' is not specified in `params`, it defaults to the draw method of the type of the returned diagram (`type(diagram).draw`).
3. **File Path Construction**: The function constructs two file paths: 
   - `true_path`: This path points to a reference image that should be compared against.
   - `test_path`: A temporary path where the generated image will be saved for comparison purposes.
4. **Image Generation and Comparison**:
   - It uses the `draw` method of the diagram object to generate an image, saving it at the `test_path`.
   - The `compare_images` function is then called with `true_path` and `test_path`, along with a tolerance value (`tol`) that determines how close the images should be to pass the comparison.
5. **Assertion**: An assertion test checks whether the result of the image comparison is `None`. If it is not, an error would occur due to the assertion failure.
6. **Cleanup**: Finally, the temporary file at `test_path` is removed using `os.remove()`.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary imports are present (e.g., `os`, and any custom `compare_images` function) for this code to work correctly. Additionally, make sure that the paths specified (`folder`, `file`) exist or are appropriately set up before calling the `wrapper`.

***
## FunctionDef tikz_and_compare(file, folder)
**tikz_and_compare**: The function of `tikz_and_compare` is to generate TikZ diagrams from given diagrams and compare them with baseline diagrams.

**Parameters**:
- `file`: A string representing the name of the file for which the diagram will be generated.
- `folder`: A string indicating the folder where the generated files (both true and test) will be saved.
- `params`: Additional keyword arguments that can include parameters such as `draw` to specify how the diagrams are drawn, and other options like `use_tikzstyles`.

**Code Description**: The function `tikz_and_compare` is a higher-order function that returns a decorator. This decorator takes a diagram-producing function (`func`) as an argument and wraps it with additional functionality for generating TikZ code from the output of this function and comparing it against a baseline.

1. **Diagram Generation**:
   - The wrapped function `wrapper()` first calls `func()` to generate the diagram.
   - It retrieves the drawing method using `params.get('draw', type(diagram).draw)`, which defaults to the default drawing method for the given diagram class if not specified in `params`.
   
2. **File Paths**:
   - The function sets up file paths for both true and test versions of the generated TikZ diagrams.
   - If `use_tikzstyles` is set to `True` (default behavior), it adds an additional path for `.tikzstyles` files.

3. **Drawing and Comparison**:
   - It uses the specified drawing method (`draw`) to generate the diagram, saving it as a test file.
   - The function then reads both the true and test TikZ files line by line using `open(true_path, "r")` and `open(test_path, "r")`.
   - An assertion is made to ensure that the contents of these two files are identical, asserting the correctness of the generated diagram.
   - Finally, it deletes the test file.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - The function handles potential errors gracefully by ensuring the content of both files matches exactly before cleaning up any temporary files created during testing.

**Note**: Ensure that `os` is imported at the beginning of your script to use functions like `open`, `join`, and `remove`. Also, consider setting appropriate values for `params` when calling decorated functions to avoid unexpected behavior. The function assumes that the diagram-producing function returns a class instance with a method named `draw`.

**Output Example**: No explicit return value is expected from this function; instead, it performs side effects such as file creation and deletion. A successful run will result in no assertion errors, indicating that the generated TikZ diagrams match their baseline counterparts.
### FunctionDef decorator(func)
**decorator**: The function of decorator is to wrap a given function `func` that returns a diagram and compare its TikZ drawing output against expected files.
**parameters**: 
· func: A callable that returns a Discopy diagram when called without arguments.

**Code Description**: This code defines a decorator named `decorator`. It takes a single argument, `func`, which is assumed to be a function returning a Discopy diagram. The core functionality of this decorator involves comparing the TikZ drawing output generated by `func` with expected files stored in specific paths.

1. **Inner Function (`wrapper`)**: A nested function named `wrapper` is defined within `decorator`. This function performs the actual work.
2. **Diagram Creation**: Inside `wrapper`, `diagram = func()` invokes the provided function `func` to create a Discopy diagram.
3. **Drawing Configuration**: The variable `draw` is set to the value of `'draw'` in `params`, or defaults to `type(diagram).draw` if this key does not exist in `params`.
4. **Path Setup**: Two lists, `true_paths` and `test_paths`, are initialized with file paths for storing TikZ drawings.
5. **TikZstyles Handling**: If the `'use_tikzstyles'` parameter is set to `True`, additional paths are added to both `true_paths` and `test_paths` to accommodate `.tikzstyles` files.
6. **Drawing Execution**: The `draw(diagram, path=test_paths[0], **dict(params, to_tikz=True))` line generates the TikZ drawing of the diagram using the specified parameters and saves it to the test file path.
7. **File Comparison**: A loop iterates over corresponding elements in `true_paths` and `test_paths`, reading the content of each file and comparing them with an assertion statement. If any discrepancy is found, an AssertionError will be raised.
8. **Cleanup**: After comparison, the temporary test files are removed using `os.remove(test_path)`.

**Note**: Ensure that the paths in `true_paths` and `test_paths` are correctly set to avoid errors during file operations. The decorator assumes that `params` is a dictionary containing relevant parameters for drawing and comparison.

**Output Example**: No explicit return value is defined; instead, the output is implicit through assertions within the code. If all comparisons pass without raising an AssertionError, it indicates successful matching of generated TikZ drawings with expected files.
#### FunctionDef wrapper
**wrapper**: The function of wrapper is to draw diagrams using TikZ and compare the generated output files.

**parameters**: This Function does not explicitly take any parameters. However, it relies on external variables defined in `params` and `DRAWING_DEFAULT`.

- `params`: A dictionary containing various parameters for drawing, including whether to use TikZ styles (`use_tikzstyles`) and a default path for the output files.
- `func()`: A function that returns a diagram object. This is not defined within this wrapper but should be provided by the caller.

**Code Description**: The code performs the following steps:

1. **Diagram Generation**: It calls `func()` to get a diagram object, which is assumed to be already defined and passed in from an external source.
2. **Drawing Configuration**: It retrieves the drawing function (`draw`) from the `params` dictionary or uses the default draw method based on the type of the diagram if no specific draw function is provided.
3. **File Paths Setup**: It sets up paths for storing the generated TikZ files, with a test path prefixed by an underscore to distinguish it from the true path used for comparison.
4. **TikZ Styles Consideration**: If `params['use_tikzstyles']` is set to `True`, it appends additional file paths that include a `.tikzstyles` extension.
5. **Drawing and File Comparison**:
   - It draws the diagram using the specified drawing function, saving the output to the test path with TikZ enabled if applicable.
   - For each true and test path pair, it reads the contents of both files.
   - Using an `assert` statement, it checks that the contents of the true and test paths are identical.
6. **Cleanup**: After the comparison, it removes the test file.

**Note**: Ensure that `func()` returns a valid diagram object before calling this wrapper function. Also, make sure that the environment has necessary permissions to read and write files in the specified directories.

## FunctionDef tuplify(stuff)
**tuplify**: The function of tuplify is to ensure that its input is always returned as a tuple.
**Parameters**: 
· stuff: The stuff to turn into a tuple.

**Code Description**: The `tuplify` function takes any input and checks if it is already a tuple. If the input is not a tuple, it wraps it in a single-element tuple; otherwise, it returns the input as-is. This utility function ensures that subsequent operations expecting tuples can handle both individual elements and collections uniformly.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring type consistency across various parts of the project. For instance:
- In `discopy/python.py/Function/__init__`, `tuplify` is used to ensure that the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) types are consistently treated as tuples, even if they contain only one element.
- Similarly, in `discopy/python.py/Function/then`, `tuplify` ensures that the results of function compositions are always returned as tuples, maintaining consistency across operations.

By standardizing input handling to tuples, this utility simplifies the implementation and maintenance of functions throughout the project. It helps prevent errors related to type mismatches and ensures that the codebase remains robust against changes in input formats.

**Note**: While `tuplify` is designed to handle any input type, it is essential to use it consistently across all relevant parts of the codebase. Misuse or inconsistent application can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with complex function compositions and transformations.

**Output Example**: If you call `tuplify(5)`, it will return `(5,)`. If you call `tuplify((1, 2))`, it will return `(1, 2)` without any change.
## FunctionDef untuplify(stuff)
**untuplify**: The function of `untuplify` is to extract an element from a tuple if it has exactly one item; otherwise, it returns the original tuple.
**Parameters**:
· stuff: The input tuple out of which to extract the element.

**Code Description**: 
The `untuplify` function checks the length of the input tuple. If the tuple contains exactly one element, that single element is returned. Otherwise, the original tuple is returned unchanged. This behavior makes it useful for situations where a tuple might contain either a single value or multiple values, and you want to handle these cases differently.

The `untuplify` function is often used in scenarios where operations need to be performed on individual elements of a tuple if they are singular, but the tuple should remain unchanged if it contains more than one item. For example, when constructing graphs or hypergraphs, tuples might represent different types of nodes or edges, and `untuplify` ensures that single-element tuples can be processed appropriately.

In the context of the project, `untuplify` is called in several places:
- In the `apply` method of the `Hypergraph.from_callable.decorator`, it processes the output of a function application, ensuring that if multiple outputs are produced, they remain as a tuple. If only one output is generated, it extracts and returns just that output.
- In the `id` function from the `Function` class in `python.py`, it constructs an identity function for a given type structure, converting any single-element input into its individual component while preserving multiple inputs as tuples.
- In the `swap.inside` method of the `Function` class, it rearranges elements within a tuple to swap positions, ensuring that the output maintains the correct structure based on the number of elements.

**Note**: Be cautious when using this function in contexts where you expect single-element tuples. If the input is not guaranteed to be a tuple or does not contain exactly one element, unexpected behavior may occur. Ensure that the input types and structures are well-defined before calling `untuplify`.

**Output Example**: 
- Input: `(1,)`  
  Output: `1`
- Input: `(1, 2)`  
  Output: `(1, 2)`
- Input: `[3, 4]` (Note: This is not a tuple but a list. The function expects a tuple)  
  Raises an error or returns the original input depending on how it is implemented in the calling context.

### FunctionDef then(self, other)
**then**: The function of `then` is to sequentially compose two or more composable objects.

**Parameters**:
· other: The other composable object to be composed sequentially with the current instance.
· others: Additional composable objects that will be composed sequentially after `other`.

**Code Description**:
The `then` method in the `Composable` class is designed for sequential composition, allowing multiple composable objects to be chained together. This method takes an optional first argument `other`, which can either be a single `Composable` object or `None`. If provided, it will be composed with the current instance of `Composable`. Following `other`, any number of additional `Composable` objects (`*others`) can also be passed to further extend the composition. The method returns a new `Composable` object that represents the sequential composition of all input objects.

This method is crucial for building complex composable structures in a sequential manner, enabling developers to create intricate diagrams or circuits by chaining operations together. For example, if you have multiple operations represented as `Composable` instances, you can use `then` to combine them into a single structure, ensuring that they are executed in the correct order.

**Note**: Ensure that all arguments passed to `then` are valid `Composable` objects. If `other` is not provided and no additional `*others` are given, the method will likely return the current instance of `Composable`. It's important to validate the types of inputs to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

In relation to its callers in the project:
- The `repeat` method in `Matrix` uses `then` to generate reflexive transitive closures. Specifically, it composes an identity matrix with a boolean matrix multiple times using `then`, creating a sequence that represents repeated applications of the original matrix.
- The test function `test_Arrow_then` demonstrates how `then` can be used in practice by showing its behavior with simple `Box` instances. This example helps ensure that `then` works as expected when chaining operations, which is crucial for testing and validating the functionality of composable structures.

By understanding how `then` works and observing its usage in both production code (`repeat`) and test scenarios (`test_Arrow_then`), developers can effectively utilize this method to build complex and interconnected composable objects.
***
### FunctionDef is_composable(self, other)
**is_composable**: The function of `is_composable` is to check if two composable objects can be composed together based on their domain and codomain.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `self`: An instance of the `Composable` class representing the first object.
· parameter2: `other`: An instance of the `Composable` class representing the second object.

**Code Description**: The function `is_composable` checks if two composable objects can be composed by verifying that the codomain of the first object matches the domain of the second object. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the composition is possible. This function is crucial for ensuring that operations between different composable objects in the project are valid.

The `is_composable` method is called within the `assert_iscomposable` function, which raises an error if the two provided composable objects cannot be composed according to their domain and codomain properties. Specifically, `assert_iscomposable` uses `left.is_composable(right)` to validate that the object on the left can be composed with the object on the right before proceeding with further operations.

This method plays a critical role in maintaining consistency and correctness in the composition of composable objects within the project, ensuring that only valid compositions are performed. By using this method, developers can avoid errors due to incorrect domain and codomain matching during operation chaining or transformation processes.

**Note**: Ensure that both `self` and `other` are instances of the `Composable` class to prevent runtime errors. The function will return `False` if the domains and codomains do not match, indicating that the objects cannot be composed.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example 1: Valid composition
left = Composable(dom=3, cod=4)
right = Composable(dom=4, cod=5)
assert left.is_composable(right) == True

# Example 2: Invalid composition
left = Composable(dom=3, cod=4)
wrong_right = Composable(dom=6, cod=7)
assert left.is_composable(wrong_right) == False
```
***
### FunctionDef is_parallel(self, other)
**is_parallel**: The function of `is_parallel` is to determine whether two composable objects share the same domain and codomain.
· parameter1: self - The calling object, which must be an instance of Composable.
· parameter2: other - Another composable object to compare with.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_parallel` method checks if the domains and codomains of two given composable objects are identical. It returns a boolean value indicating whether both objects have matching domain and codomain pairs, which is crucial for operations that require parallel arrows in category theory and diagrammatic representations.

This function plays a key role in various parts of the project:
- In `discopy/cat.py/Arrow/__eq__`, it ensures that two arrows are not only of the same type but also have matching domains and codomains before considering them equal.
- Similarly, in `discopy/cat.py/Box/__eq__`, `Drawing/__eq__`, and other classes where equality is defined based on structural properties, this method helps validate whether the objects can be considered equivalent under certain conditions.

**Note**: Ensure that both inputs are instances of Composable before calling this function. The function assumes that the domain (dom) and codomain (cod) attributes are correctly set for each composable object.
**Output Example**: If `self` and `other` have the same domain and codomain, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. For example:

```python
# Assuming a is an instance of Composable with dom = A and cod = B
# And b is another instance of Composable with dom = A and cod = B
result = a.is_parallel(b)  # Returns True

# If c has different domain or codomain, say dom = C and cod = D
result = a.is_parallel(c)  # Returns False
```

### FunctionDef id(cls, dom)
**id**: The function of `id` is to create an identity Whiskerable object on a given domain.
**Parameters**:
· dom: The object on which to take the identity.

**Code Description**: 
The `id` method in the `Whiskerable` class generates an identity transformation for a specified input, `dom`. This method is called when a non-Whiskerable object needs to be transformed into a Whiskerable one. If `other` (in the context of its caller) is not already a Whiskerable instance, then this method will create and return a new identity Whiskerable object with the given domain.

The relationship between `id` and its caller `whisker`:
- The `whisker` method checks whether an input (`other`) is an instance of `Whiskerable`. If it is, no transformation is needed, and the original object is returned.
- If `other` is not a Whiskerable instance, then the `id` method is called to create an identity Whiskerable object with the domain of `other`.
- This process ensures that any input can be uniformly treated as a Whiskerable object within the `Whiskerable` class hierarchy.

**Note**: Ensure that the domain (`dom`) provided to the `id` function is correctly defined and compatible with the operations intended for the Whiskerable objects. Incorrect or undefined domains may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.
***
### FunctionDef tensor(self, other)
**tensor**: The function of tensor is to perform parallel composition between two diagrams.
**parameters**: 
· other: The other diagram to compose in parallel.

**Code Description**: The `tensor` method is responsible for creating a parallel composition of two diagrams, where the input diagram (`self`) and another diagram (`other`) are combined side by side. This operation is fundamental in categorical quantum mechanics and related areas, as it allows for the representation of multi-qubit systems or operations that act on multiple subsystems simultaneously.

This method is called internally when using the `@` operator between two diagrams. Specifically, it is used within the `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__` methods to facilitate the composition process:

- In `__matmul__(self, other)`, the current diagram (`self`) is tensor-composed with a whiskered version of `other`. This means that `other` is first "whiskered" (i.e., its vertical structure is maintained but it is placed in parallel), and then both diagrams are composed.
- In `__rmatmul__(self, other)`, the process is reversed. A whiskered version of the current diagram (`self`) is tensor-composed with `other`.

These methods ensure that the `tensor` operation can be used seamlessly through operator overloading, making the code more intuitive and easier to read.

**Note**: When using the `tensor` method, ensure that both diagrams are compatible in terms of their structure. Incompatible diagrams may lead to errors or unexpected behavior during composition. Additionally, while the tensor product is a powerful tool for combining operations, it should be used judiciously to maintain clarity and correctness in your diagrammatic representations.
***
### FunctionDef whisker(cls, other)
**whisker**: The function of `whisker` is to ensure that an input object can be uniformly treated as a Whiskerable instance by either returning the original object if it already is or creating an identity transformation with the given domain.

**Parameters**:
· other: The whiskering object. This parameter should be an object that needs to be transformed into a Whiskerable instance.

**Code Description**: 
The `whisker` method checks whether the input `other` is an instance of `Whiskerable`. If it is, then `other` itself is returned without any modification. However, if `other` is not already a Whiskerable instance, the method calls the `id` method to create and return a new identity Whiskerable object with the domain of `other`.

This process ensures that operations within the `Whiskerable` class hierarchy can be performed uniformly on all types of input objects. The `whisker` method plays a crucial role in handling inputs that do not natively belong to the `Whiskerable` class, making them compatible for further transformations or compositions.

The `whisker` method is called by the `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__` methods. In these contexts, it ensures that any object on the right-hand side of a tensor product operation can be appropriately transformed into a Whiskerable instance before proceeding with the actual tensor product or whiskering operation.

**Note**: Ensure that the domain provided to the `id` function is correctly defined and compatible with the operations intended for the Whiskerable objects. Incorrect or undefined domains may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.

**Output Example**: If `other` is a non-Whiskerable object, the method will return an identity Whiskerable object created from `other`. For example:
```python
# Assuming 'x' is not a Whiskerable instance
result = Whiskerable.whisker(x)
```
In this case, `result` would be a new Whiskerable instance representing the identity transformation of `x`. If `x` was already a Whiskerable instance, then `result` would simply be `x`.

This ensures that any input can seamlessly participate in tensor product or whiskering operations within the `Whiskerable` class.
***
### FunctionDef __matmul__(self, other)
**__matmul__**: The function of __matmul__ is to perform tensor composition between two diagrams.
· self: The current diagram instance.
· other: The other diagram to compose in parallel.

**Code Description**: 
The `__matmul__` method facilitates the tensor product (parallel composition) of two diagrams. It returns a new Whiskerable object resulting from tensoring the current diagram (`self`) with a whiskered version of `other`. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Self Parameter**: The `self` parameter represents the current instance of the `Whiskerable` class, which is being operated on.
2. **Other Parameter**: The `other` parameter is another Whiskerable object that needs to be tensor-composed in parallel with the current diagram.

The method works by first ensuring that `other` can be uniformly treated as a Whiskerable instance through the `whisker` method call. If `other` is already an instance of `Whiskerable`, it returns `other`. Otherwise, it creates an identity transformation for `other` using the `id` method.

The result of this process is then passed to the `tensor` method, which performs the actual parallel composition between the two diagrams (`self` and the whiskered version of `other`). This operation is fundamental in categorical quantum mechanics and related fields, allowing for the representation of multi-qubit systems or operations that act on multiple subsystems simultaneously.

**Note**: Ensure that both diagrams are compatible in terms of their structure. Incompatible diagrams may lead to errors or unexpected behavior during composition.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming 'self' is a Whiskerable instance and 'other' is another diagram
result = self @ other
```
In this example, `result` would be a new Whiskerable object representing the tensor product of `self` and `other`. If `other` was not already a Whiskerable instance, it would first be transformed into one through the `whisker` method before the actual tensor composition occurs.
***
### FunctionDef __rmatmul__(self, other)
**__rmatmul__**: The function of `__rmatmul__` is to perform right tensor composition between two diagrams.
· parameter1: other - The other diagram to compose in parallel.

**Code Description**: The `__rmatmul__` method facilitates the right tensor product operation, which is a fundamental concept in categorical quantum mechanics and related fields. It ensures that when an instance of `Whiskerable` (let's call it `self`) is on the left side of the `@` operator and another object (`other`) is on the right, the two are combined using a parallel composition.

The method works as follows:
1. **Whiskering**: The `whisker(other)` method is called to ensure that `other`, if not already an instance of `Whiskerable`, is treated uniformly by converting it into a Whiskerable identity transformation with the domain of `other`. This step guarantees compatibility between `self` and `other`.
2. **Tensor Composition**: After ensuring both diagrams are compatible, the method returns the result of tensoring `self` with the whiskered version of `other`. The `tensor` method (discussed in detail below) performs this parallel composition.

**Note**: This method is particularly useful for creating complex diagrammatic representations in a more readable and intuitive manner. It ensures that any object on the right-hand side can be seamlessly transformed into a Whiskerable instance before performing the tensor product, making the code more flexible and easier to use.

**Output Example**: Suppose `self` represents a quantum circuit with some operations and `other` is an operation that needs to be applied in parallel. The result of `__rmatmul__(self, other)` would return a new Whiskerable instance representing the combined diagram where `self` and `other` are composed side by side.

For example:
```python
# Assuming 'self' is a quantum circuit with operations and 'gate' is an operation to be applied in parallel.
result = self @ gate
```
In this case, `result` would represent the new combined diagram where `gate` is applied alongside the operations in `self`.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, f)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the classproperty decorator.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: f (The function that will be decorated by the classproperty)

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in this code snippet serves as a constructor for the `classproperty` decorator. It takes a single argument, `f`, which is expected to be a function that needs to be decorated with the `classproperty` functionality.

Here’s a detailed analysis of what happens within the `__init__` method:
1. **Initialization**: The first line of the `__init__` method assigns the value passed as `f` (the function being decorated) to an instance variable named `self.f`. This allows the decorator to remember the original class method or property that it is wrapping.
2. **Decorator Design Pattern**: By using this constructor, the `classproperty` can be used in a way similar to how other Python decorators are applied. The actual decoration logic (i.e., converting an instance method into a class method) will be implemented later within another method like `__get__`, which is called when accessing the property on a class or subclass.

This design pattern ensures that any function passed to `classproperty` can be treated as both a regular instance method and a class method, providing flexibility in how properties are accessed and used throughout the codebase.

**Note**: When using this decorator, ensure that the function `f` is correctly defined and accessible. Also, remember that the actual behavior of accessing the property (e.g., calling it on a class or an instance) will be handled by another method (`__get__`), which is not shown in this snippet but should be implemented to fully realize the decorator's functionality.
***
### FunctionDef __get__(self, _, x)
**__get__**: The function of __get__ is to return the result of applying the function `f` to an instance `x`.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self (an instance of the class containing this method)
· parameter2: _ (a placeholder for the instance, usually not used in the body of the method)
· parameter3: x (the instance on which the property is being accessed)

**Code Description**: The `__get__` method is a special method that is part of Python's descriptor protocol. It is called when an attribute reference is made with this descriptor as its primary target. In this case, it takes the function `f` and applies it to the instance `x`, returning the result. This mechanism allows for defining properties in a class where you can control how the property value is retrieved.

The method signature includes three parameters:
1. `self`: The first parameter refers to the object on which the descriptor is being accessed.
2. `_`: A placeholder that typically does not get used within the body of this method, as it is often ignored in favor of using `self`.
3. `x`: Represents the instance of the class where the property is being accessed.

The implementation simply returns the result of calling `f(x)`, which implies that `f` should be a callable object (such as another function or a method) that accepts an instance and performs some computation on it.

**Note**: When defining properties using this mechanism, ensure that `f` is a well-defined callable. The placeholder `_` can sometimes be removed if not needed in the implementation logic.

**Output Example**: If `f` is defined as a function that adds 1 to its input, and an instance `x` has a value of 5, then calling `__get__` would return `6`. For example:
```python
def f(x):
    return x + 1

class MyClass:
    @classproperty
    def my_property(cls):
        return classmethod(f)

# Assuming the above code is part of a class definition
my_instance = MyClass()
result = my_property.__get__(None, my_instance)
print(result)  # Output: 6 (assuming `x` has a value of 5)
```

### FunctionDef __init__(self, kind)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the attributes of a Node instance.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: kind (required), representing the type or category of the node.
· parameter2: data (optional keyword arguments), containing additional properties and their corresponding values for the node.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes the Node object with two main attributes: `kind` and `data`. The `kind` attribute is set to the value passed as the first argument, while `data` is a dictionary that stores key-value pairs representing additional properties of the node. 

For each key-value pair in the `data` dictionary, the method uses the `setattr` function to dynamically add these attributes to the Node instance. This allows for flexible and extensible initialization where any number of properties can be defined when creating an instance.

Here is a detailed breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method takes two parameters: `self`, which refers to the instance being created, `kind`, and `data`. 
2. **Setting Attributes**:
   - `self.kind = kind`: This line assigns the value of `kind` to the `kind` attribute of the Node instance.
   - `self.data = data`: The `data` dictionary is assigned directly to the `data` attribute, allowing it to be accessed later as needed.
3. **Dynamic Attribute Assignment**:
   - A loop iterates over each key-value pair in the `data` dictionary using `items()`.
   - For each key and value, `setattr(self, key, value)` is called. This method dynamically adds an attribute to the instance with the specified name (`key`) and assigns it the corresponding value.

This approach ensures that any additional properties passed as keyword arguments can be easily accessed via their respective names on the Node instance.

**Note**: Ensure that all required attributes are provided during initialization, especially `kind`, as it is marked as a mandatory parameter. The use of dynamic attribute assignment with `setattr` provides flexibility in defining and accessing node properties at runtime.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to compare whether two Node objects are equal based on their kind and data attributes.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: other - This is the object that will be compared with the current Node instance for equality.

**Code Description**: 
The `__eq__` method in the Node class is designed to determine if two Node instances are considered equal. It checks whether the 'other' object being compared is an instance of the Node class and then compares the attributes `kind` and `data` of both objects. If these attributes match, the method returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The detailed code analysis:
1. The function starts with a condition to check if `other` is an instance of the Node class using `isinstance(other, Node)`. This ensures that only Node instances can be compared.
2. If `other` is indeed a Node, the method then compares the `kind` and `data` attributes of both objects using the tuple comparison `(self.kind, self.data) == (other.kind, other.data)`.
3. The use of a tuple comparison allows for an efficient and clear way to check if all elements in these two tuples are equal.
4. If both conditions are met, meaning `other` is a Node instance with identical `kind` and `data`, the method returns True, indicating that the two objects are considered equal.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that any object you compare using this method is indeed an instance of Node to avoid type errors.
- The equality check relies on the `kind` and `data` attributes, so make sure these attributes are correctly set for your Node instances.

**Output Example**: 
If two Node objects have identical `kind` and `data`, the output will be True. For example:
```python
node1 = Node("add", 5)
node2 = Node("add", 5)
print(node1 == node2)  # Output: True

node3 = Node("sub", 7)
print(node1 == node3)  # Output: False
```
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Node instance.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters as it operates on the instance itself.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method returns a string that represents the object in a way that can be used to recreate the object or for debugging purposes. In this case, the returned string is constructed using an f-string and formatted to provide detailed information about the Node instance.

- The first part of the return statement constructs a string with `Node({repr(self.kind)}, {", ".join(f"{key}={value}" for key, value in sorted(self.data.items()))})`. 
- `self.kind` is passed through `repr()` to ensure it is represented as a string.
- `self.data` is a dictionary containing additional information about the Node. The items from this dictionary are iterated over and formatted into a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, where each pair is sorted by keys for consistency in output representation.

For example:
- If `self.kind` is `"apple"` and `self.data` contains `{ "color": "red", "size": "small" }`, the method will return: 
```python
"Node('apple', color=red, size=small)"
```

**Note**: Ensure that all attributes of the Node class are properly defined and accessible for accurate representation. The use of `sorted` ensures that the order of key-value pairs in the output is consistent, which can be particularly useful for debugging.

**Output Example**: 
If a Node instance has `kind = "banana"` and `data = { "length": 10, "weight": 250 }`, then:
```python
"Node('banana', length=10, weight=250)"
```

This output helps in understanding the state of the Node object both for debugging and logging purposes.
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to return a unique hash value for the node instance.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method in the Node class returns a hash value based on the string representation (`repr`) of the current node instance. Here, `repr(self)` provides a comprehensive and unambiguous string representation of the object, which is then hashed using Python's built-in `hash` function. This ensures that each unique node instance will have a distinct hash value, facilitating efficient use in data structures such as sets and dictionaries.
**Note**: 
- The uniqueness of the hash value depends on the uniqueness of the node's string representation. If two nodes are considered equal by their `__eq__` method, they must return the same hash value to maintain consistency with Python’s hashing mechanism.
- Using `repr(self)` ensures that the hash is based on a complete and unambiguous representation of the object, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

**Output Example**: 
If the node instance has attributes like `name = "node1"` and `value = 42`, then `repr(node_instance)` might output something like `'Node(name="node1", value=42)'`. The hash of this string would be returned by `__hash__`. For example, if the hash of the string is 3756987123, then `node_instance.__hash__()` will return `3756987123`.
***
### FunctionDef shift_i(self, i)
**shift_i**: The function of shift_i is to create a new Node instance by incrementing the `i` attribute of the current Node by a specified value.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: i (integer) - An integer value that will be added to the existing `i` attribute of the current Node.

**Code Description**: 
The function `shift_i` is defined within the `Node` class and takes one argument, `i`, which represents an integer. This function returns a new instance of `Node` with the same `kind` as the original node but with its `i` attribute incremented by the value provided in `i`. 

Here's a detailed analysis:
- The function starts with the line `return Node(self.kind, **dict(self.data, i=self.i + i))`. This line creates and returns a new instance of `Node`.
- `self.kind` is passed as the first argument to the constructor of `Node`, ensuring that the new node has the same kind as the original one.
- The `**dict(self.data, i=self.i + i)` part is used to merge dictionaries. It takes the existing data attributes (`self.data`) and updates the `i` attribute by adding the value passed in `i`.
- This approach ensures that all other attributes remain unchanged while only updating or creating a new node with an incremented `i`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `i` parameter is provided as an integer. If not, it may lead to unexpected behavior.
- The function does not modify the original `Node` object but creates and returns a new one.

**Output Example**: 
If you have a Node instance with `kind='example'`, `data={'a': 10}`, and `i=5`, calling `shift_i(3)` would result in a new Node with:
- kind: 'example'
- data: {'a': 10}
- i: 8 (since 5 + 3 = 8)
***
### FunctionDef shift_j(self, j)
**shift_j**: The function of shift_j is to create a new Node instance by shifting the value of `j` by a specified amount.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: self - This refers to the current instance of the Node class, allowing methods to access and manipulate its attributes.
· parameter2: j - An integer representing the amount by which the existing `j` attribute should be incremented.

**Code Description**: The function `shift_j` takes an integer `j` as input and returns a new Node object with updated data. Specifically, it creates a copy of the current Node instance while modifying its `j` attribute by adding the value of `j` to the existing `j` value. This is achieved using keyword arguments (`**dict(self.data, j=self.j + j)`) to pass all the attributes from the original node plus the updated `j`.

The function uses the `Node` class constructor to initialize a new Node instance with the same `kind` as the current instance and updated data dictionary. The key difference is that the `j` value in this new instance will be the sum of the current `j` value and the input parameter `j`, thus shifting it by the specified amount.

**Note**: Ensure that the `data` attribute of the Node class contains a valid key for `j`, otherwise, you might encounter an error during the dictionary update. Also, note that this method does not modify the original node but returns a new instance with the updated value.

**Output Example**: If there is a Node instance with `kind='example'` and `data={'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'j': 5}`, calling `shift_j(3)` would return a new Node instance with `kind='example'`, `data={'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'j': 8}`.
***
## ClassDef Point
**Point**: The function of Point is to represent a coordinate point on a 2D plane using its x and y coordinates.
**Attributes**:
· x: Represents the horizontal position (x-coordinate) of the point.
· y: Represents the vertical position (y-coordinate) of the point.

**Code Description**: 
The class `Point` is defined as a subclass of `NamedTuple`, which means it inherits all properties and methods from `NamedTuple`. This class represents a simple 2D coordinate system point with two attributes, `x` and `y`, both of type float. The constructor of the class takes in these two parameters to initialize the coordinates.

The class also includes a method:
· `shift(self, x=0, y=0)`: This method allows for the adjustment of the current position of the point by adding specified values (defaulting to 0) to its existing x and y coordinates. The resulting new point is returned as another instance of the Point class.

**Note**: 
- When calling the `shift` method, you can pass in custom values for `x` and `y`. If no arguments are provided, the default value (0) will be used, meaning that the position of the point remains unchanged.
- The `NamedTuple` base class ensures that instances of Point have a convenient representation and comparison mechanism.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Creating a Point instance at coordinates (3.5, 2.1)
point = Point(3.5, 2.1)

# Shifting the point by (-1.0, 1.5)
new_point = point.shift(-1.0, 1.5)

print(new_point)  # Output: Point(x=2.5, y=3.6)
```
### FunctionDef shift(self, x, y)
**shift**: The function of shift is to move the point by a specified amount along both axes.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: x (int or float) - The horizontal distance to shift the point by. Default value is 0.
· parameter2: y (int or float) - The vertical distance to shift the point by. Default value is 0.

**Code Description**: This function takes a Point object and two optional parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the horizontal and vertical shifts respectively. It returns a new Point object whose coordinates are the sum of the original coordinates and the provided shifts. If no values are provided for `x` and `y`, it means there is no shift applied along either axis.

In more detail:
1. The function receives a Point object, which implies that the method `shift` is defined within or as part of the Point class.
2. It accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. These are optional with default values of 0 if not provided by the caller.
3. For each parameter (both x and y), it adds the value to the corresponding coordinate (`self.x` for `x`, `self.y` for `y`) of the Point object on which the method is called.
4. The result is a new Point object with updated coordinates.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the values passed as `x` and `y` are either integers or floats to maintain consistency in coordinate representation.
- This function does not modify the original Point object but returns a new one, which is useful for operations requiring immutable objects.

**Output Example**: If you have a Point at (1, 2) and call `shift(3, 4)`, it will return a new Point object located at (4, 6). If you call `shift(-1, -1)` on the same point, it would result in a new Point at (0, 1).
