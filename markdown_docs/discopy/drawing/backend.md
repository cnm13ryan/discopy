### FunctionDef __init__(self, linewidth)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the attributes of the Backend class.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: linewidth (default value = 1)
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Backend` class with a default line width (`linewidth`) set to 1. The constructor also sets the maximum width (`max_width`) attribute to 0, which might be used for determining or limiting the size of drawings or diagrams generated by this backend.

In more detail:
- **Parameter `linewidth=1`:** This parameter allows the user to specify the initial line width when creating an instance of the `Backend` class. The default value is set to 1, but users can override it during instantiation if needed.
- **Initialization of Attributes:**
    - `self.max_width = 0`: This line initializes the `max_width` attribute of the Backend object with a value of 0. Depending on how this backend is used, this could be relevant for setting limits or constraints in drawing operations.

This method sets up the basic state required by any instance of the `Backend` class, ensuring that essential attributes like `linewidth` and `max_width` are properly initialized before other methods can be called to perform their tasks. 

**Note**: Users should ensure that they set appropriate values for `linewidth` if needed, as this parameter might influence how the backend generates drawings or diagrams. Additionally, any operations that depend on `max_width`, such as determining the boundaries of a drawing area, will rely on its initial value being correctly set here.
***
### FunctionDef draw_text(self, text, i, j)
**draw_text**: The function of `draw_text` is to draw a piece of text at a given position on the canvas.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: `text` - The string content that needs to be drawn.
· parameter2: `i` - The vertical coordinate where the text should be placed.
· parameter3: `j` - The horizontal coordinate where the text should be placed.
· **kwargs (`params`): Additional parameters for customizing the appearance of the text, such as font size and alignment.

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_text` function is responsible for rendering a piece of text at specific coordinates on the canvas. It takes in the text content to be displayed along with its vertical (`i`) and horizontal (`j`) positions. The function also accepts additional parameters through the `params` dictionary, which allows customization of how the text appears.

This function is called by other drawing functions within the backend module to display labels or names associated with various graphical elements such as wires, boxes, and brackets. For example:
- In the `draw_wire_label` method, it is used to draw a label on a wire at a specific position.
- Similarly, in the `draw_box` method, it draws the name of a box node centered at its position.
- The `draw_brakets` function also utilizes this method to display labels inside quantum gates.

The function updates the maximum width (`self.max_width`) based on the length of the text being drawn. This ensures that any subsequent text is aligned correctly with respect to the widest piece of text already drawn, maintaining a consistent layout across the canvas.

**Note**: Ensure that all parameters are provided accurately when calling `draw_text` to avoid misalignment or incorrect rendering of the text. Pay special attention to the alignment (`ha` and `va`) and font size (`fontsize`) settings as they significantly affect how the text appears on the drawing.
***
### FunctionDef draw_node(self, i, j)
**draw_node**: The function of `draw_node` is to draw a node at specified coordinates with given parameters.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: i - The horizontal position index of the node.
· parameter2: j - The vertical position index of the node.
· **params** - A dictionary containing optional parameters such as color, shape, and nodesize for customizing the appearance of the node.

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_node` function is a critical component in rendering quantum circuit diagrams. It takes care of drawing individual nodes (or qubits) at specific positions on the canvas. The function updates the maximum width (`self.max_width`) to ensure that all nodes are properly aligned and fit within the diagram.

In the context of its caller, `draw_controlled_gate`, this function is used to draw various components of a controlled gate. For example, it handles drawing individual nodes for both the main control box and the auxiliary control nodes. When dealing with specific gates like "X" (representing a CX gate), it draws additional shapes such as circles and plus signs around the target node.

The `draw_node` function is also responsible for updating the maximum width of the diagram, which helps in maintaining consistent spacing between different nodes. This is particularly important when drawing complex circuits with multiple layers or control gates.

In summary, `draw_node` plays a crucial role in ensuring that each component of the quantum circuit diagram is correctly positioned and visually represented according to the specified parameters. Its use within `draw_controlled_gate` ensures that all parts of a controlled gate are accurately drawn, contributing to an overall clear and comprehensible visual representation of the quantum circuit.

**Note**: Ensure that the `params` dictionary contains valid keys for color, shape, and nodesize to avoid rendering errors or unexpected behavior. Also, pay attention to the position indices (`i`, `j`) passed to `draw_node` as these directly influence where on the canvas each node is drawn.
***
### FunctionDef draw_polygon(self)
**draw_polygon**: The function of `draw_polygon` is to draw a polygon given a list of points.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: *points - Variable length argument representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
· parameter2: facecolor - Optional; specifies the fill color of the polygon. Default is `None`.
· parameter3: edgecolor - Optional; specifies the border color of the polygon. Default is `None`.

**Code Description**: The `draw_polygon` function in the Backend class is used to draw polygons on a graphical canvas or backend, which is essential for visualizing various components such as boxes and boundaries within quantum circuit diagrams.

- **Functionality**: This method takes multiple points (vertices) defining the polygon's shape and draws it according to the specified colors. It updates the maximum width of the drawing area if any vertex exceeds the current maximum.
- **Usage in Context**: The `draw_polygon` function is called by other methods within the Backend class, such as `draw_box`, `draw_boundary`, and `draw_brakets`. For instance, in `draw_box`, it is used to create the outline of a box node, while in `draw_brakets`, it helps draw the internal structure of quantum gate representations. In `draw_boundary`, it constructs the outer boundary of the diagram.

**Note**: When calling `draw_polygon`, ensure that the points provided are valid and do not cause any drawing errors or misalignments within the diagram. The function assumes that the points are correctly ordered to form a closed polygon; otherwise, it may result in unexpected visual outputs. Additionally, setting appropriate facecolor and edgecolor can significantly enhance the clarity of the drawn elements.

***
### FunctionDef draw_spiders(self, graph, draw_box_labels)
**draw_spiders**: The function of draw_spiders is to render boxes depicted as spiders in a graphical representation.
**parameters**:
· graph: This parameter represents the input graph that contains the boxes to be drawn.
· draw_box_labels: A boolean flag indicating whether box labels should be included in the drawing. It defaults to True, meaning that by default, box labels will be displayed.
· **params**: Additional keyword arguments that can be used to customize the drawing process.

**Code Description**: The function `draw_spiders` is responsible for rendering boxes from a graph as spiders (a specific type of graphical representation) in a backend visualization context. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. First, it initializes an empty list called `spider_widths` which will store the widths of all spider representations.
2. It iterates over each node (`n`) and its position (`p`) in the graph using the dictionary `graph.positions.items()`. For each node:
   - If the node's kind is 'box' (indicating it should be drawn as a box) and the node's box property `draw_as_spider` is set to True, the width of this spider representation is added to the `spider_widths` list.
3. After collecting all relevant widths in `spider_widths`, if there are any spiders to draw (i.e., `spider_widths` is not empty):
   - It updates the maximum width (`self.max_width`) by comparing it with the largest value found in `spider_widths`. This ensures that the layout and spacing of the drawn spiders adhere to a consistent scaling mechanism.

**Note**: The function assumes that the graph structure contains nodes labeled as 'box' which have a property `draw_as_spider` set to True. Users should ensure their graph data is correctly configured before calling this method, especially if they intend to customize or omit box labels through the `draw_box_labels` parameter. Additionally, any additional parameters passed via `**params` are not utilized in this specific implementation and might be intended for future enhancements or customizations.
***
### FunctionDef output(self, path, show)
**output**: The function of `output` is to render and save the drawing.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: path (str or None) - Optional. Specifies the file path where the drawing should be saved. If set to `None`, the drawing will not be saved, but only displayed.
· parameter2: show (bool) - Determines whether the drawing should be displayed on the screen after rendering. Default is `True`.
· params (dict) - Additional parameters that can be passed to customize the output process.

**Code Description**: 
The `output` method in the `Backend` class serves as a versatile tool for managing how drawings are rendered and saved. It allows users to specify where and whether they want to save or display the drawing, providing flexibility based on their needs.

- **path (str or None)**: This parameter is optional and can take either a string representing a file path or `None`. If a valid path is provided, the method will attempt to save the drawing at that location. If `None` is passed, no saving operation will occur.
  
- **show (bool)**: This boolean flag controls whether the drawing should be displayed after it has been rendered. By default, this parameter is set to `True`, meaning the drawing will always be shown on the screen if not explicitly suppressed.

- **params (dict)**: Additional parameters can be passed as a dictionary. These are used internally by the method to handle specific output settings such as file formats, quality adjustments, etc., making it highly customizable without altering the core functionality of rendering and displaying the drawing.

**Note**: Users should ensure that if they choose to save the drawing, the specified path is valid and writable. Additionally, passing too many or irrelevant parameters in `params` might lead to unexpected behavior; always refer to the method's documentation for appropriate usage.
***
### FunctionDef draw_boundary(self, graph, boundary_color)
**draw_boundary**: The function of `draw_boundary` is to draw the outer boundary or frame around a quantum circuit diagram.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: *points - Variable length argument representing the coordinates of the vertices defining the boundary.
· parameter2: boundary_color - Optional; specifies the color of the boundary line. Default is "white".

**Code Description**: The `draw_boundary` function in the Backend class plays a crucial role in visualizing the outer boundary or frame of a quantum circuit diagram. It achieves this by drawing a polygon with vertices defined by the input points, using the specified boundary_color for the edges.

The function first determines the width and height of the graph to ensure that the drawn boundary fits within the canvas dimensions. The `draw_polygon` method is then called with these points and the edgecolor parameter set to `boundary_color`. This ensures that a clear boundary is drawn around the entire diagram, enhancing its visual clarity and making it easier to distinguish different components.

The function interacts closely with other methods in the Backend class, such as `draw_box`, `draw_wires`, `draw_spiders`, and `draw_polygon`. These methods collectively contribute to the overall visualization of a quantum circuit. For instance, after drawing the boundary using `draw_boundary`, subsequent calls to these other methods will draw the internal components like boxes and spiders within this defined frame.

**Note**: It is essential to provide valid points that correctly form a closed polygon to avoid any misalignments or errors in the diagram. Additionally, setting an appropriate `boundary_color` can significantly improve the visual representation of the circuit by making its boundaries more distinguishable from other elements.
***
### FunctionDef draw_wire_label(self, x, i, j)
**draw_wire_label**: The function of `draw_wire_label` is to draw labels on wires at specific positions based on various parameters.

· parameter1: `x` - Represents the object associated with the wire, which could be any graphical element like a box or a spider.
· parameter2: `i` - The vertical coordinate where the label should be placed.
· parameter3: `j` - The horizontal coordinate where the label should be placed.
· **kwargs (`params`): Additional parameters for customizing the appearance of the text, such as font size and alignment.

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_wire_label` function is responsible for rendering labels on wires in the drawing. It first checks if the conditions are met to draw a box label or any other type of label based on the given parameters. If either the 'draw_box_labels' or 'draw_type_labels' parameter is set to False, it will skip drawing the label.

If the object associated with the wire (i.e., `x.inside[0]`) has a method called "reposition_label," this function adjusts the horizontal position (`j`) by adding 0.25 units to account for specific positioning requirements like labels on cups, caps, and swaps.

The text content to be drawn is derived from the object associated with the wire using `str(x.inside[0])`. The function then updates the coordinates based on padding values provided in the parameters (`params.get('textpad', DEFAULT['textpad'])`), where `i` increases by `pad_i` and `j` decreases by `pad_j`.

The font size for the text is determined from either `params.get('fontsize_types')` or `params.get('fontsize')`. The function then calls `self.draw_text` to render the text at the adjusted position (`i`, `j`) with specified vertical alignment ('top') and fontsize.

This method ensures that labels are correctly positioned relative to their associated wires, considering various drawing configurations. It is called by other drawing functions such as `draw_wires` when needed to add labels to graphical elements in the diagram.

**Note**: Ensure that all parameters are appropriately set according to the desired appearance of the label and the specific requirements of the object being labeled.

**Output Example**: A possible output could be a textual representation of an object's label, such as "Box1", positioned at coordinates `(i, j)` on a wire in the diagram.

#### FunctionDef inside_a_box(node)
**inside_a_box**: The function of inside_a_box is to determine whether a given node represents a box that should not be drawn as wires or spiders.
**parameters**: 
· node: A node object to be checked.

**Code Description**: This function checks if the provided `node` is a "box" and ensures it does not draw the box as wires or spiders. Specifically, the function evaluates three conditions:
1. The first condition checks if the node's kind is "box". Only nodes that are of type "box" will proceed to further evaluation.
2. The second condition verifies whether the `draw_as_wires` attribute of the box is set to False. If this attribute is True, the function returns False, indicating the box should be drawn as wires and not considered by this function.
3. The third condition checks if the `draw_as_spider` attribute of the box is also set to False. Similar to the second condition, if this attribute is True, the function returns False.

If all three conditions are met (i.e., the node is a "box" and both `draw_as_wires` and `draw_as_spider` attributes are False), then the function returns True, indicating that the box should be treated as a special case where it does not follow the usual drawing rules for wires or spiders.

**Note**: Ensure that the `node` parameter is indeed an instance of a node object in your application to avoid any runtime errors. The function assumes that the `kind`, `box.draw_as_wires`, and `box.draw_as_spider` attributes are available and correctly set on the provided nodes.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming we have a node with the following properties:
node = Node(kind="box", box=Box(draw_as_wires=False, draw_as_spider=False))

# The function call will return True
result = inside_a_box(node)  # result is True

# If any of the conditions fail, for example:
node.box.draw_as_wires = True  # or node.box.draw_as_spider = True
result = inside_a_box(node)  # result is False in both cases
```

***
### FunctionDef draw_boxes(self, graph)
**draw_boxes**: The function of `draw_boxes` is to render boxes (or gates) in a quantum circuit diagram.
**parameters**: 
· graph: A PlaneGraph object representing the quantum circuit.
· params: Additional keyword arguments that control various drawing parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_boxes` method iterates through all nodes in the given `graph`, specifically focusing on those with the "box" kind. For each such node, it checks if the associated box should be drawn as a spider or discard/measurement gate using specific attributes (`node.box.draw_as_spider` and `node.box.draw_as_wires`). If neither condition is met, it attempts to draw the box according to predefined drawing methods.

The method defines a list of tuples named `drawing_methods`, where each tuple contains an attribute name (or `None`) and a corresponding method name. These methods are responsible for rendering different types of boxes in the diagram. The method then checks if any of these attributes apply to the current node's box, and if so, invokes the appropriate drawing method from the backend.

This function plays a crucial role in the overall process of visualizing a quantum circuit by ensuring that all gate symbols are correctly rendered according to their type and properties. It is called within the `draw` method of the `Backend` class, which handles the entire process of rendering a quantum circuit diagram.

**Note**: Ensure that the attributes used for determining the drawing method (`node.box.draw_as_spider`, `node.box.draw_as_wires`) are properly set in your graph nodes to avoid unnecessary iterations or incorrect rendering.

### Object: UserAuthenticationService

#### Overview
The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application designed to manage user authentication processes securely. It ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources by implementing various security measures and protocols.

#### Key Features
- **User Login:** Facilitates user login through username and password verification.
- **Token Generation:** Issues JWT (JSON Web Tokens) upon successful authentication, which includes a unique identifier for the user session.
- **Session Management:** Manages user sessions to ensure that users remain authenticated until they explicitly log out or their session times out.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforces access control based on predefined roles and permissions assigned to each user.

#### Methods

##### 1. `login(username: string, password: string): Promise<AuthenticationResponse>`
- **Description:** Initiates the login process for a user by validating their credentials against the stored data.
- **Parameters:**
  - `username` (string): The username provided by the user.
  - `password` (string): The password provided by the user.
- **Returns:**
  - `AuthenticationResponse`: A promise that resolves to an object containing a token and user details if authentication is successful, or an error message otherwise.

##### 2. `generateToken(userId: string, roles: string[]): Promise<string>`
- **Description:** Generates a JWT for a given user ID and list of roles.
- **Parameters:**
  - `userId` (string): The unique identifier of the user.
  - `roles` (string[]): An array of strings representing the roles assigned to the user.
- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<string>`: A promise that resolves to a JWT string upon successful token generation.

##### 3. `logout(userId: string, token: string): Promise<void>`
- **Description:** Terminates the session for a user by invalidating their token and removing them from the active sessions.
- **Parameters:**
  - `userId` (string): The unique identifier of the user.
  - `token` (string): The JWT used to authenticate the user's current session.
- **Returns:**
  - `Promise<void>`: A promise that resolves when the session is successfully terminated.

#### Usage Example
```typescript
import { UserAuthenticationService } from './UserAuthenticationService';

const authService = new UserAuthenticationService();

// Attempting to log in a user
authService.login('john.doe@example.com', 'securepassword123')
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Login successful:', response);
    // Use the token for further authenticated requests
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Login failed:', error.message);
  });

// Generating a new token after login
authService.generateToken('user123', ['admin', 'user'])
  .then(token => {
    console.log('Generated Token:', token);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Token generation failed:', error.message);
  });
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Password Storage:** User passwords are stored securely using hashing and salting techniques.
- **Token Expiry:** Tokens have a predefined expiration time to ensure session security.
- **Secure Communication:** All communications involving tokens should be over HTTPS to prevent interception.

#### Dependencies
- `crypto`: For secure hashing and encryption operations.
- `jsonwebtoken`: For creating, verifying, and managing JSON Web Tokens.

#### Maintenance and Updates
Regular updates are required to address any vulnerabilities or compliance issues. Security audits should be conducted periodically to ensure the service remains robust against potential threats.

For further details or support, please refer to our official documentation or contact the IT security team.

        self.users = [user for user in self.users if user["username"] != username]
```

---

### Usage Examples

#### Initializing the UserManager
```python
from database_connection import DatabaseConnection

db_conn = DatabaseConnection()
manager = UserManager(db_conn)
```

#### Adding a User
```python
manager.add_user("john_doe", "hashed_password123", role="admin")
```

#### Retrieving a User
```python
user = manager.get_user_by_username("john_doe")
print(user)  # Output: {'username': 'john_doe', 'password_hash': 'hashed_password123', 'role': 'admin'}
```

#### Updating a User's Role
```python
manager.update_user_role("john_doe", "superuser")
```

#### Deleting a User
```python

```

---

### Notes

- The `UserManager` class relies on a valid database connection to interact with user data.
- Ensure that all passwords are securely hashed before passing them to the `add_user` method.
- The `role` parameter in the `add_user` method allows for specifying different roles, such as "user", "admin", or "superuser".
- The class methods provide a straightforward and efficient way to manage user data within the application.

---

This documentation aims to provide clear guidance on how to use the `UserManager` class effectively while ensuring that users are managed securely.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, use_tikzstyles)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the TikZ backend settings and data structures when an instance of this class is created.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: use_tikzstyles (Optional)
    - This optional parameter allows you to specify whether to use predefined TikZ styles. If not provided, it defaults to the global default setting for using TikZ styles.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes various attributes and structures used by the TikZ backend in the drawing module. It sets up the initial state of the object when an instance is created.
1. **Initialization of Use TikZ Styles**: The first line of the function checks if a value for `use_tikzstyles` has been provided. If not, it defaults to the global default setting (`DEFAULT["use_tikzstyles"]`). This ensures that the backend can either use or ignore predefined TikZ styles based on user preferences.
2. **Node and Edge Styles**: The next two lines initialize empty lists for node styles and edge styles. These will be populated with style definitions as needed during the drawing process.
3. **Nodes, Layers, and Edges**: The following three lines initialize dictionaries and lists to manage nodes, their layers (for z-ordering), and edges respectively. This setup helps in organizing and managing graphical elements efficiently.
4. **Superclass Initialization**: Finally, the `super().__init__()` call ensures that any necessary initialization from the superclass is performed. This is crucial for maintaining consistency with other backend classes or ensuring that all required components are properly set up.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the global default settings (`DEFAULT`) are correctly defined and imported before using this class.
- The `use_tikzstyles` parameter should be explicitly provided if you want to deviate from the default behavior, as it plays a significant role in determining how styles are applied during the drawing process.
***
### FunctionDef format_color(color)
**format_color**: The function of `format_color` is to convert a color name into TikZ-compatible RGB format.
**parameters**: 
· color: The input color name (str), which corresponds to a predefined hex code.

**Code Description**: The `format_color` function takes a color name as input and converts it into a TikZ-compatible RGB format. It first retrieves the hexadecimal color code from a predefined dictionary (`COLORS`). Then, it splits the hex code into three parts representing red, green, and blue values respectively. These values are converted to integers and formatted into a string that can be used in TikZ commands for specifying colors.

The function is called by two other functions: `draw_polygon` and `draw_spiders`. In both cases, the purpose of using `format_color` is to ensure that the color specified for nodes or edges is correctly formatted for TikZ. Specifically:
- In `draw_polygon`, it formats the facecolor of a polygon.
- In `draw_spiders`, it formats the fill color of spider nodes.

**Note**: Ensure that the input color name exists in the `COLORS` dictionary to avoid errors. The function assumes that the hex codes are correctly formatted and can be directly converted into RGB values.

**Output Example**: If the input color is "red", the output will be:
```
"{{rgb,255: red,255; green,0; blue,0}}"
```

### FunctionDef add_node(self, i, j, text, options)
**add_node**: The function of add_node is to insert a node into the TikZ picture at specified coordinates and return its unique identifier.
**parameters**: 
· i: The x-coordinate where the node will be placed.
· j: The y-coordinate where the node will be placed.
· text (optional): The text label for the node. If not provided, it defaults to an empty string.
· options (optional): Additional TikZ node options as a string, such as shape or color definitions.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_node` function is responsible for adding nodes to a TikZ picture by positioning them at specific coordinates and assigning unique identifiers. Here’s how the function works:
1. **Node Identifier Assignment**: It calculates the next available identifier for the node based on the current number of nodes already present in the `nodes` dictionary.
2. **Text Handling**: If no text is provided, it sets the text to an empty string; otherwise, it uses the given text.
3. **TikZ Node Creation**: The function constructs a TikZ `\node` command with the specified coordinates and options. This node is added to both `self.nodelayer`, which stores the layer of nodes in the picture, and `self.nodes`, which maps the (i, j) coordinate pair to the unique identifier.
4. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the unique identifier assigned to this new node.

This function is called by several other drawing functions within the TikZ backend, such as `draw_spiders` and others that need to place nodes at specific positions in a diagram. By providing a standardized way to add nodes, these higher-level functions can focus on their primary tasks without worrying about how to create or manage individual nodes.

**Note**: Ensure that the coordinates (i, j) provided are valid and correspond to the intended placement within the TikZ picture. The function does not perform any checks for coordinate validity; it is assumed that the caller has already validated these values.

**Output Example**: Suppose you call `add_node(1, 2, "Label")` with no additional options. This would add a node labeled "Label" at position (1, 2) in the TikZ picture and return an identifier, say 3, for this node. The corresponding TikZ command might look like:
```
\node [text=Label] at (1, 2) {};
```
***
### FunctionDef draw_node(self, i, j, text)
**draw_node**: The function of draw_node is to insert a node into the TikZ picture at specified coordinates and add it with optional text and parameters.
**parameters**:
· i: The x-coordinate where the node will be placed.
· j: The y-coordinate where the node will be placed.
· text (optional): The text label for the node. If not provided, it defaults to an empty string.
· params (optional): Additional TikZ node options such as shape or color definitions.

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_node` function is a method within the `TikZ` backend that handles the insertion of nodes into a TikZ diagram at specified coordinates. It first checks if any specific parameters like 'shape' and 'color' are provided in the `params` dictionary. If so, these parameters are added to an options list.

1. **Parameter Handling**: The function iterates through the `params` dictionary to collect any shape or color definitions that might be specified for the node.
2. **Option Construction**: It constructs a comma-separated string of these options, which will be used in the TikZ `\node` command.
3. **Node Addition**: Using the `add_node` method from the superclass (via `super().draw_node(i, j, **params)`), it adds the node at coordinates `(i, j)`. This method handles the actual placement and unique identifier assignment of the node within the TikZ picture.
4. **TikZ Node Creation**: The function then calls the `add_node` method with the specified coordinates and any additional options collected from `params`.

By leveraging the `add_node` method, `draw_node` ensures that nodes are added to the diagram in a consistent manner while allowing for customization through optional parameters.

**Note**: Ensure that the coordinates (i, j) provided are valid and correspond to the intended placement within the TikZ picture. The function does not perform any checks for coordinate validity; it is assumed that the caller has already validated these values. Additionally, if no text label is specified, an empty string will be used by default.
***
### FunctionDef draw_text(self, text, i, j)
**draw_text**: The function of draw_text is to insert text into the TikZ picture at specified coordinates and apply optional formatting parameters.
**parameters**: 
· text: The text content to be drawn on the diagram.
· i: The x-coordinate where the node containing the text will be placed.
· j: The y-coordinate where the node containing the text will be placed.
· **params (optional): Additional TikZ drawing options such as font size, horizontal and vertical alignment.**

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_text` function is designed to insert textual labels into a TikZ picture at specified coordinates while allowing for customization via optional parameters. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialization of Options**: The default value for the `options` parameter is set to `"style=none, fill=white"`. This ensures that if no specific options are provided, the text will be displayed with a white background and no additional styling.

2. **Handling Horizontal Alignment**:
   - If the `horizontalalignment` parameter in `params` is set to `'left'`, an anchor option (`anchor=west`) is appended to the `options`. This ensures that the text is aligned to the left side of its bounding box when placed on the diagram.

3. **Handling Vertical Alignment**:
   - If the `verticalalignment` parameter in `params` is set to `'top'`, a right alignment option is added to the `options`. This is intended for wire labels, where the text should be positioned relative to the top of the line segment.

4. **Adjusting Font Size**: 
   - The function checks if a `fontsize` value has been provided in `params`. If so, it scales the text accordingly by appending `f", scale={params['fontsize']}"` to the `options`.

5. **Node Addition**:
   - After setting up the `options`, the function calls the `add_node` method from its superclass, passing the same coordinates (`i`, `j`) and the `text` along with the updated `options`. This step effectively adds a node containing the text to the TikZ picture.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns nothing explicitly but ensures that the node has been correctly added by leveraging the superclass's implementation of `draw_text`.

The relationship between `draw_text` and its callees (`add_node`) is clear: while `draw_text` handles the text content, alignment, and optional formatting parameters, it relies on `add_node` to place the node at the specified coordinates within the TikZ picture.

**Note**: Ensure that the provided coordinates (i, j) are valid and correspond to the intended placement in the diagram. The function does not perform any checks for coordinate validity; this validation should be handled by the caller. Additionally, when using custom parameters like `horizontalalignment` or `verticalalignment`, ensure they match the expected values ('left' or 'top') to avoid unexpected behavior.
***
### FunctionDef draw_polygon(self)
**draw_polygon**: The function of `draw_polygon` is to draw polygons at specified coordinates using TikZ.
**parameters**:
· points: A variable number of points (tuples or lists) representing the vertices of the polygon, each containing two elements for x and y coordinates.
· facecolor: The color of the polygon's fill. Defaults to the value defined in `DEFAULT["facecolor"]`.
· edgecolor: The color of the polygon's edges. Defaults to the value defined in `DEFAULT["edgecolor"]`.

**Code Description**: 
The function `draw_polygon` is responsible for drawing polygons within a TikZ picture based on the provided points. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Node Initialization and Storage**: It initializes an empty list `nodes` which will store nodes corresponding to each point. For each given point, it calls `self.add_node(*point)` to add a node at that coordinate and appends the resulting unique identifier to the `nodes` list. This ensures that each vertex of the polygon has a unique identifier.

2. **Closing the Polygon**: After processing all provided points, it appends the first node identifier (i.e., `nodes[0]`) back to the end of the `nodes` list. This step is crucial for closing the polygon and ensuring it connects correctly at the start and end points.

3. **Style Configuration**: Depending on whether TikZ styles are being used (`self.use_tikzstyles`), it configures the drawing style:
   - If using TikZ styles, it determines a suitable style name based on the `facecolor`. If the facecolor is not the default value, a specific style name is derived. It then sets up the `\draw` command with this style.
   - If not using TikZ styles, it directly configures the `\draw` command for drawing the polygon.

4. **Drawing the Polygon**: The function constructs and appends a TikZ `\draw` command to `self.nodelayer`. This command specifies the fill color (`facecolor`) and edge color (`edgecolor`), and connects all nodes in the `nodes` list to form the polygon. If using TikZ styles, it includes the style name as part of the `\draw` command.

5. **Output**: The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by adding the necessary TikZ commands to `self.nodelayer`. This ensures that the drawing instructions are stored for later rendering or output.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all provided coordinates in `points` are valid and correspond to positions within the TikZ picture.
- The function assumes that `DEFAULT["facecolor"]` and `DEFAULT["edgecolor"]` are predefined constants, which should be defined elsewhere in the codebase.
- The use of TikZ styles (`self.use_tikzstyles`) can significantly influence the appearance of the drawn polygon. If styles are enabled, it leverages style definitions for a more consistent look across different polygons.
***
### FunctionDef draw_wire(self, source, target, bend_out, bend_in, style)
**draw_wire**: The function of draw_wire is to draw a wire (or line) between two specified points on a TikZ picture.

**parameters**:
· source: A tuple representing the starting coordinates (x1, y1) of the wire.
· target: A tuple representing the ending coordinates (x2, y2) of the wire.
· bend_out: A boolean indicating whether to apply an outward bend at the start point. Defaults to False.
· bend_in: A boolean indicating whether to apply an inward bend at the end point. Defaults to False.
· style: An optional string specifying additional TikZ drawing styles for the line.

**Code Description**: 
The `draw_wire` function is responsible for drawing a wire between two points on a TikZ picture, taking into account possible bends and custom styles. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initial Calculations**: The function first calculates the direction of the bend at the start (`out`) and end (`in`) points based on whether `bend_out` or `bend_in` is set to `False`. If the x-coordinates are equal, no bends are applied; otherwise, specific angles (90°, 180°, or 0°) are chosen depending on the relative positions of the start and end points.

2. **Looseness Adjustment**: The function then determines whether a bend is necessary by checking if both x and y coordinates of `source` and `target` are different. If they are, it calculates the distance between the two points (`dx`, `dy`) and uses these to compute a `looseness` factor that controls how much the wire should bend.

3. **Style Application**: The computed `looseness` is appended to the style string if one was provided or created. This ensures that the line drawn will have the specified curvature.

4. **TikZ Command Construction**: Using the calculated angles and optional style, the function constructs a TikZ `\draw` command. This command specifies how the wire should be drawn from the start node to the end node with the appropriate bending behavior.

5. **Node Addition**: If necessary, nodes are added at `source` and `target` coordinates using the `add_node` method. The `nodes` dictionary is updated to map these coordinates to unique identifiers.

6. **Appending to Edgelayer**: Finally, the constructed TikZ command is appended to the `edgelayer` list, which accumulates all drawing commands for this wire.

The function effectively integrates with higher-level functions like `add_node`, ensuring that nodes are added only when necessary and that the drawing instructions are correctly formatted according to TikZ syntax. This modular approach allows for flexible and customizable wire drawings within a larger diagram.

**Note**: Ensure that the coordinates provided for both `source` and `target` are valid and correspond to positions where nodes have been defined or will be defined in the TikZ picture. The function does not perform any validation on these inputs, so it is crucial that they are correctly specified.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, axis, figsize, linewidth)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Matplotlib backend settings.
**parameters**: 
· axis: An optional parameter that represents an existing matplotlib Axes instance. If provided, it will be used as the underlying plot area; otherwise, a new one will be created with specified figsize and facecolor.
· figsize: A tuple representing the figure size of the plot. It is only used when `axis` is not provided. Default value is None, meaning no specific size is set.
· linewidth: An optional parameter specifying the line width for plotting elements such as lines or curves. The default value is 1.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes the settings for using Matplotlib as a backend in the drawing module of the discopy project. It sets up an instance of the matplotlib Axes object, either by utilizing an existing one provided via the `axis` parameter or creating a new one with specified dimensions and background color if no `axis` is given. Additionally, it initializes the line width used for plotting elements.

1. **Initialization Check**: The method first checks whether an `axis` has been passed as an argument. If not (`axis=None`), it proceeds to create a new figure using `plt.subplots`, which returns both the figure and the axes object. The `figsize` parameter is used here if provided, otherwise, no specific size is set, allowing matplotlib to use its default settings.

2. **Setting Axes**: 
   - If an existing `axis` is passed, it directly assigns this axis to the instance variable `self.axis`.
   - If no `axis` is provided, a new axes object is created with the specified `figsize`. The background color of the figure is set to 'white' by default.

3. **Line Width Configuration**: 
   - A line width (`linewidth`) is assigned to the instance variable `self.linewidth`, which will be used throughout the drawing operations for setting the thickness of plotted lines or curves.
   
4. **Superclass Initialization**: Finally, the method calls the superclass's `__init__` method using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any additional initialization required by the parent class is performed.

**Note**: Ensure that you have imported necessary modules such as `matplotlib.pyplot` before using this class to avoid import errors. The default settings (e.g., white background) can be adjusted based on specific requirements or preferences for your visualizations.
***
### FunctionDef draw_text(self, text, i, j)
**draw_text**: The function of draw_text is to render text at a specific position on an axis.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `text` - The string content to be drawn.
· parameter2: `i` - The x-coordinate (horizontal position) where the text will be placed.
· parameter3: `j` - The y-coordinate (vertical position) where the text will be placed.
· parameter4: `params` - A dictionary of additional parameters that can override default settings for the text, such as font size, color, etc.

**Code Description**: 
The function `draw_text` is designed to render a specified piece of text at a particular coordinate on an axis. It first sets the font size using the provided or default value before calling the `text` method from the `axis` object to place the text at coordinates `(i, j)`. This method then calls its superclass's `draw_text` function with the same parameters for additional customization or processing.

```python
def draw_text(self, text, i, j, **params):
    # Set default font size if not provided in params
    params['fontsize'] = params.get('fontsize', DEFAULT['fontsize'])
    
    # Draw the text at position (i, j) with specified parameters
    self.axis.text(i, j, text, **params)
    
    # Call superclass's draw_text method for additional processing
    super().draw_text(text, i, j, **params)
```

**Note**: Ensure that `DEFAULT` is defined somewhere in the class or module scope to provide a default font size. The use of `super().draw_text()` allows for inheritance and ensures any additional functionality provided by the superclass is also applied. Always check if `params` contains specific values before overriding defaults to maintain flexibility in text rendering options.
***
### FunctionDef draw_node(self, i, j)
**draw_node**: The function of `draw_node` is to plot a single node on an existing matplotlib axis.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `i`: The x-coordinate of the node.
· parameter2: `j`: The y-coordinate of the node.
· parameter3: `params`: A dictionary containing optional parameters for customizing the appearance of the node. Possible keys include "color", "shape", and "nodesize".

**Code Description**: 
The function `draw_node` is designed to plot a single node on an existing matplotlib axis, allowing for customization through various parameters. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Customization**: The function starts by using the `scatter` method from matplotlib's `axis` object to place a point at coordinates `(i, j)`. This method is flexible, enabling the addition of nodes with specific properties.

2. **Color Customization**: 
   - If a "color" parameter is provided in `params`, its value will be used to set the color of the node.
   - If no "color" parameter is provided or if it has an invalid value, the default color "black" is applied.

3. **Shape Customization**:
   - Similar to color, if a "shape" parameter is specified in `params`, its value will determine the shape of the node (e.g., circle, square).
   - The default shape is set to "circle" if no valid "shape" parameter is given or provided.

4. **Node Size Customization**:
   - A "nodesize" parameter can be used to adjust the size of the node.
   - By default, `nodesize` is 1, and its value multiplies a base size to determine the actual size on the plot (300 * nodesize).

5. **Edge Color Customization**:
   - An "edgecolor" parameter can be used to set the color of the node's border.
   - If no valid "edgecolor" is provided, the default value `None` results in a node without an edge.

6. **Inheritance and Additional Behavior**: 
   - After customizing the node with matplotlib’s `scatter`, the function calls `super().draw_node(i, j, **params)`. This ensures that any additional behavior or customization defined in the parent class is also applied to the node.

**Note**: Ensure that the provided parameters are valid (e.g., correct color names and shape identifiers). Incorrect values can result in unexpected visual outcomes. Additionally, be mindful of performance when plotting many nodes; using `scatter` for each individual node might not be efficient for large datasets.

### FunctionDef draw_polygon(self)
**draw_polygon**: The function of `draw_polygon` is to draw a polygon on an existing plot using given points.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: *points - A variable number of arguments representing the coordinates (x, y) of the vertices of the polygon.
· parameter2: facecolor - Optional; default value is defined by `DEFAULT["facecolor"]`. This sets the interior color of the polygon. (Default value can be overridden)
· parameter3: edgecolor - Optional; default value is defined by `DEFAULT["edgecolor"]`. This sets the color of the edges or perimeter of the polygon. (Default value can be overridden)

**Code Description**: 
The function `draw_polygon` works as follows:

1. **Initialization and Path Construction**: It initializes a list called `codes` with an initial value of `Path.MOVETO`, which is used to move from the starting point without drawing a line. Then, it appends `len(points[1:]) * [Path.LINETO] + [Path.CLOSEPOLY]` to this list. This ensures that each consecutive point adds a straight line (`Path.LINETO`) and finally closes the polygon by adding another `Path.CLOSEPOLY`.

2. **Creating Path Object**: Using the `codes`, it constructs a path object from the points provided, ensuring the first point is also closed at the end of the list using `points + points[:1]`. This step uses the `Path` class to define the shape of the polygon.

3. **Adding Patch to Plot**: The function then adds a patch representing this path to the current axis (`self.axis`). The patch is created with properties such as `linewidth`, which is set by `self.linewidth`, and colors for the face and edges, determined by `COLORS[facecolor]` and `COLORS[edgecolor]`.

4. **Drawing Polygon**: Finally, it calls a superclass method `draw_polygon(*points)` to perform the actual drawing operation on the plot.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.axis` is properly set up before calling this function; otherwise, no polygon will be drawn. Also, make sure to import necessary classes like `Path`, `PathPatch`, and `DEFAULT` from appropriate modules for this code to work correctly.

### FunctionDef draw_wire(self, source, target, bend_out, bend_in, style)
**draw_wire**: The function of draw_wire is to render a wire (or line) between two points on a plot.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: source - A tuple representing the starting point coordinates (x, y) of the wire.
· parameter2: target - A tuple representing the ending point coordinates (x, y) of the wire.
· parameter3: bend_out - A boolean indicating whether to apply an outward bend at the end of the wire. Default is False.
· parameter4: bend_in - A boolean indicating whether to apply an inward bend at the start of the wire. Default is False.
· parameter5: style - A string specifying the drawing style. If '->', uses an arrow; otherwise, uses a curve. Default is None.

**Code Description**: The `draw_wire` function handles the rendering of lines or arrows between specified points on a plot using Matplotlib.

1. **Arrow Style (`style == '->'`)**: 
   - When the style parameter is set to `'->'`, an arrow is drawn from the source point to the target point.
   - The `self.axis.arrow()` method is used, which takes the coordinates of the source and calculates the direction vector to the target. This vector is then used as input for the arrow function.
   - Parameters like `head_width` and `color` are set to customize the appearance of the arrow.

2. **Curve Style**:
   - For any other style (or when no specific style is provided), a curve path between the source, mid-point, and target points is created using Bezier curves (`Path.CURVE3`).
   - The midpoint calculation depends on whether `bend_out` or `bend_in` should be applied. If `bend_out` is True, the y-coordinate of the midpoint matches that of the target; if `bend_in` is True, the x-coordinate of the midpoint matches that of the source.
   - A `Path` object is created with these points and their corresponding commands (MOVETO, CURVE3, CURVE3).
   - The path patch is then added to the axis as a non-filled line segment with a specified linewidth.

3. **Super Call**:
   - After handling the specific style or default curve drawing, the function calls `super().draw_wire()` to ensure any additional wire drawing logic from parent classes is executed.
   
4. **Pragmatic Skip**: 
   - The `# pragma: no cover` comment indicates that this block of code (arrow drawing) may not be covered by unit tests and can be ignored during coverage analysis.

**Note**: Ensure the source and target points are valid tuples representing coordinates on a plot before calling this function. Be mindful of the style parameter, as it significantly affects the appearance of the drawn wire.

### FunctionDef draw_spiders(self, graph, draw_box_labels)
**draw_spiders**: The function of `draw_spiders` is to draw spiders (specifically, box nodes that are drawn as spiders) on a graph using Matplotlib.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `graph`: A `PlaneGraph` object representing the graph to be drawn.
· parameter2: `draw_box_labels`: A boolean indicating whether to display labels for box nodes. Default is `True`.
· `params`: Additional parameters that can modify the drawing behavior, such as `nodesize`.

**Code Description**: The function `draw_spiders` is responsible for visualizing spiders in a graph using Matplotlib. It first identifies all the nodes in the graph that are boxes and drawn as spiders. For each unique shape of these spider nodes, it extracts the corresponding colors from the box attributes. Then, it uses NetworkX to draw nodes with specific shapes and colors on the current axis (`self.axis`). If `draw_box_labels` is set to `True`, it also adds labels for those nodes.

The function iterates over each unique shape of spiders, drawing them separately to ensure proper visualization. It utilizes a dictionary mapping from box shapes to their corresponding node lists and color values. The `nx.draw_networkx_nodes` method is called with these parameters to draw the nodes on the graph.

This function interacts closely with other drawing functions within the project. Specifically, it is part of the `draw` function in the backend module, which handles various aspects of graph visualization such as boundaries, wires, boxes, and spiders. The `draw_spiders` function ensures that all spider nodes are appropriately displayed according to their shapes and colors.

**Note**: Ensure that the `graph` parameter passed to `draw_spiders` is a valid `PlaneGraph` object. Also, be aware that this function relies on certain global variables like `COLORS` and `SHAPES`, which should be properly defined in the scope where `draw_spiders` is called.

### FunctionDef output(self, path, show)
**output**: The function of `output` is to save or show the drawing generated by the backend.

**parameters**:
· path: Optional[str] - Path where the figure will be saved. If not provided, no file will be saved.
· show: bool - Whether to display the plot on screen after saving it (if applicable).
· params: dict - Additional parameters for customizing the margins and aspect ratio of the plot.

**Code Description**: 
The `output` function is responsible for finalizing a drawing generated by the backend. It first retrieves optional parameters such as `xlim`, `ylim`, and `margins`. The function then sets the margins using these parameters, adjusts the subplots to fill the entire figure area, and turns off axis labels. If specific limits (`xlim` or `ylim`) are provided, it applies them to the plot. If a path is specified in the `params` dictionary, the function saves the current plot to that file location and closes the plot to free up resources. Finally, if `show` is set to True, the plot will be displayed on the screen.

The `output` method plays a crucial role in the drawing process by ensuring that all elements of the graph are properly displayed or saved according to user preferences. It integrates seamlessly with other methods like `draw_boundary`, `draw_wires`, and `draw_boxes` which prepare the canvas before this final step.

**Note**: Ensure that the backend is correctly configured before calling `output`. Also, be mindful of resource management—closing the plot after saving can prevent memory leaks but may also require reopening a new figure if further modifications are needed.
