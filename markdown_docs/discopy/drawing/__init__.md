## FunctionDef draw(diagram)
**draw**: The function of `draw` is to visualize a diagram using networkx and matplotlib.

**Parameters**:
· `diagram`: The diagram to be drawn.
· `draw_as_nodes`: Whether to draw boxes as nodes, default is `False`.
· `color`: Color of the box or node; white (`'#ffffff'`) for boxes and red (`'#ff0000'`) for nodes, respectively. Default color is white for boxes and red for nodes.
· `textpad`: Padding between text and wires, default is `(0.1, 0.1)`.
· `draw_type_labels`: Whether to draw type labels, default is `False`.
· `draw_box_labels`: Whether to draw box labels, default is `True`.
· `aspect`: Aspect ratio; one of `['auto', 'equal']`. Default aspect ratio is `'auto'`.
· `margins`: Margins for the diagram, default is `(0.05, 0.05)`.
· `nodesize`: Node size for spiders and controlled gates.
· `fontsize`: Font size for the boxes; default is `12`.
· `fontsize_types`: Font size for the types; default is `12`.
· `figsize`: Figure size.
· `path`: Where to save the image. If `None`, it calls `plt.show()`. Default is `None`.
· `to_tikz`: Whether to output tikz code instead of matplotlib, default is `False`.
· `asymmetry`: Make a box and its dagger mirror images; default is `.25 * any(box.is_dagger for box in diagram.boxes)`.

**Code Description**: The function `draw` takes a `Diagram` object as input and visualizes it using networkx and matplotlib based on the provided parameters. It first converts the `Diagram` into a `Drawing` object, which is then drawn according to the specified parameters. This function allows for extensive customization of the visualization, including box and node colors, text padding, type labels, aspect ratio, margins, fonts, and more.

The caller of this function in the project, `discopy/monoidal.py`, does not provide any documentation or code snippet, which means that users might need to refer to the `draw` function for visualization purposes directly. This function is crucial as it bridges the gap between abstract diagram representations and their visual interpretations, making it easier for developers and beginners to understand and manipulate these diagrams.

**Note**: Ensure all parameters are correctly specified according to your needs when calling this function. If you want to save the image, provide a valid `path` string; otherwise, the plot will be displayed using `plt.show()`.

**Output Example**: The output can vary based on the provided parameters but generally includes a visual representation of the diagram with boxes and nodes, type labels (if enabled), and text padding as specified. For example, if you call `draw(diagram, draw_box_labels=True, fontsize=16)`, it will produce an image where all box labels are displayed with a font size of 16.
## FunctionDef to_gif(diagram)
**to_gif**: The function of `to_gif` is to create an animated GIF showing the normalization steps of diagrams.

**Parameters**:
· diagram: :class:`Diagram`, required
    - The initial diagram or sequence of diagrams for which the normalization steps are to be visualized.
· *diagrams: :class:`Diagram`
    - Additional diagrams to include in the animation, apart from the `diagram` parameter.
· **params**: any
    - A dictionary containing optional parameters that get passed to :meth:`Diagram.draw`.

**Code Description**:
The function `to_gif` is designed to visualize the normalization process of one or more diagrams as an animated GIF. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Parameter Extraction**:
   - The function extracts the `path`, `timestep`, and `loop` parameters from the `params` dictionary.
   - If no `path` is provided, it creates a temporary file path for saving the GIF.

2. **Diagram Preparation**:
   - Converts each diagram (including any additional diagrams passed as positional arguments) into a drawing object using the `to_drawing()` method.
   - Collects these drawings into a list called `steps`.

3. **Figure Size Adjustment**:
   - If no `figsize` parameter is provided in `params`, it calculates an appropriate figure size by determining the maximum width and height across all steps.

4. **Temporary Directory Handling**:
   - Creates a temporary directory to store intermediate PNG files.
   - For each step, generates a PNG file using the `draw()` method with the specified parameters.
   - Collects these PNG files into a list called `frames`.

5. **GIF Construction**:
   - If looping is enabled (`loop=True`), it appends the frames in reverse order to create a loop effect.
   - Uses the `save()` method of the first frame to construct and save the animated GIF, setting the duration between frames using `timestep`.
   - Ensures that the GIF loops infinitely if `loop=True`.

6. **Displaying the GIF**:
   - If the IPython environment is available, it returns an HTML object containing the path to the saved GIF.
   - Otherwise, it simply returns a string with the path to the GIF.

7. **Relationship with Callers**:
   - The function `to_gif` is called from within the project's structure and is primarily used for visualizing the normalization process of diagrams in an animated format. It is not covered by tests (`# pragma: no cover`), indicating that it may be considered for internal use or demonstration purposes.

8. **Note**:
   - The function requires the `os`, `tempfile`, `PIL.Image`, and optionally `IPython.display` modules to run.
   - If IPython is not available, a static HTML string containing the GIF path will be returned instead of an interactive display.

**Output Example**:
The output would be a file path where the animated GIF is saved. In an IPython environment, it might return something like:

```html
<img src="tmp_001.gif">
```

This indicates that the GIF has been saved to a temporary location and can be viewed using a web browser or other image viewer by navigating to the specified path.
## FunctionDef spiral(n_cups)
### Object: UserAuthenticationService

**Overview:**
The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures secure and efficient login procedures to prevent unauthorized access while providing seamless user experiences.

**Key Features:**

1. **Login Functionality:** 
   - Facilitates user login using username or email and password.
   - Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) options for enhanced security.

2. **Registration Process:**
   - Enables users to register by providing necessary details such as name, email, and password.
   - Validates input data to ensure compliance with predefined rules.

3. **Password Management:**
   - Allows users to reset their passwords via email or phone number.
   - Implements complex password policies including length, character types, and expiration periods.

4. **Session Management:**
   - Manages user sessions by generating and validating session tokens.
   - Ensures session security through token encryption and short-lived durations.

5. **Security Measures:**
   - Protects against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
   - Implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login attempts.

**Methods:**

1. `login(username/email, password)`: 
   - Authenticates a user based on the provided credentials.
   - Returns a session token upon successful authentication.

2. `register(name, email, password)`: 
   - Registers a new user with the application.
   - Validates and stores the user data securely.

3. `resetPassword(email/phone)`: 
   - Initiates a password reset process for the specified user.
   - Sends a verification link or code to the provided contact method.

4. `logout()`: 
   - Ends the current user session by invalidating the session token.
   - Ensures that the user is logged out and cannot access protected resources.

5. `validateSession(token)`: 
   - Verifies if the given session token is valid and active.
   - Returns true if the token is valid, false otherwise.

**Usage Example:**

```python
from authentication_service import UserAuthenticationService

auth_service = UserAuthenticationService()

# Login a user
session_token = auth_service.login('user@example.com', 'password123')

# Register a new user
auth_service.register('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'securePassword!@#')

# Reset password for a registered user
auth_service.resetPassword('john.doe@example.com')

# Validate session token
is_valid = auth_service.validateSession(session_token)

print(is_valid)  # Output: True or False based on the validity of the session token
```

**Error Handling:**
- The `UserAuthenticationService` includes comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful feedback to users and administrators.
- Common errors include invalid credentials, expired sessions, and failed validation checks.
