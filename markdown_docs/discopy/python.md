## FunctionDef is_tuple(typ)
**is_tuple**: The function of `is_tuple` is to determine whether a given type is a tuple or a parameterized version of a tuple.
· typ: The type to check for equality with tuple.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_tuple` function checks if the provided type `typ` is either a plain tuple or a parameterized generic type that represents a tuple. It does so by utilizing the `get_origin` function from the `discopy/utils.py` module, which retrieves the base class of the given type. If the origin of the type is `tuple`, then it returns `True`, indicating that the type is indeed a tuple or a parameterized version of a tuple.

In terms of its usage within the project, `is_tuple` plays a crucial role in ensuring type safety and flexibility when dealing with tuples and their parameterizations. For example:

- In the `uncurry` function from `discopy/python.py`, `is_tuple` is used to determine whether certain types are tuples or not, which helps in deciding how to uncurry functions.
- The `__init__` method of the `Ty` class in `discopy/stream.py` uses `is_tuple` to handle initialization logic differently based on whether the base type is a tuple.

**Note**: Ensure that the provided type has an `__origin__` attribute. If it does not, `get_origin` will return the original type itself, which could lead to unexpected behavior in certain scenarios. Therefore, always verify that the type being checked supports parameterization before calling `is_tuple`.

**Output Example**: 
For a given generic type like `Tuple[int, str]`, `is_tuple(Tuple[int, str])` would return `True`. For a simple non-parameterized type like `int`, it would also return `False`.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, inside, dom, cod)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Function instance with its inside function, domain, and codomain.
· parameter1: inside (Callable): A callable object representing the core operation or transformation of the Function.
· parameter2: dom (Ty): The domain type of the Function, indicating the input type expected by the `inside` function.
· parameter3: cod (Ty): The codomain type of the Function, indicating the output type produced by the `inside` function.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up a new instance of the `Function` class. It takes three parameters: `inside`, which defines the core functionality; `dom`, representing the domain or input type; and `cod`, representing the codomain or output type. These parameters are then processed by the `tuplify` function to ensure they are consistently represented as tuples, even if they contain only one element.

The `tuplify` function is called on both `dom` and `cod`. This ensures that these types are always treated as tuples, which helps maintain consistency across various operations in the project. By converting `dom` and `cod` to tuples using `tuplify`, the method standardizes how domain and codomain information is handled, preventing potential type-related issues during function compositions or transformations.

This approach enhances the robustness of the codebase by ensuring that all Function instances have their domain and codomain types uniformly represented as tuples. This consistency simplifies the implementation and maintenance of functions throughout the project, making it easier to handle complex operations involving multiple Function instances.

**Note**: It is crucial to use `tuplify` consistently across all relevant parts of the codebase to maintain this type uniformity. Inconsistent application can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with function compositions and transformations. Always ensure that `dom` and `cod` are passed as tuples to avoid potential issues.
***
### FunctionDef id(dom)
**id**: The function of id is to create an identity function on a given type structure.
· dom (Ty): The typle of types on which to take the identity.

**Code Description**: The `id` function creates an identity function for a given tuple of types (`dom`). This means that if any input passed through this function, it will return the same input without any modification. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to maintain the original structure or type of data while performing operations.

The function works by returning a `Function` object with the following characteristics:
1. **Lambda Function**: The identity function is defined using a lambda function that takes any number of arguments (`*xs`). This lambda returns the result of applying `untuplify` to these arguments.
2. **Domain and Codomain**: Both the domain and codomain are set to be equal to `dom`, indicating that this function maps elements from `dom` back to `dom`.

The `untuplify` function, which is called within `id`, ensures that if any of the inputs passed to the lambda function are single-element tuples, they will be extracted into their individual components. If the input is a tuple with more than one element or not a tuple at all, it remains unchanged.

In functional programming terms, this identity function can be seen as an identity morphism in category theory, where the function maps each object to itself without any transformation. This makes `id` particularly useful for creating base cases in recursive definitions or for ensuring that certain parts of a computation remain untouched while other parts are modified.

**Note**: Ensure that the input type `dom` is well-defined and consistent with the expected structure of your data. The use of `untuplify` ensures that single-element tuples are handled appropriately, but it's crucial to verify that the inputs are indeed tuples or handle non-tuple inputs as needed in your application.

**Output Example**: 
- Input: `(1,)`
  Output: `1`
- Input: `(2, 3)`
  Output: `(2, 3)`
- Input: `[4, 5]` (Note: This is not a tuple but a list. The function expects a tuple)
  Raises an error or returns the original input depending on how it is implemented in the calling context.
***
### FunctionDef then(self, other)
**then**: The function of `then` is to sequentially compose two functions.
· parameter1: other : Function - The other function to compose in sequence.

**Code Description**: The `then` method performs the sequential composition of two functions, denoted by the operator `>>`. When called with another function as the argument, it returns a new function that first applies the current instance's function and then applies the provided function on its result. This operation is crucial for building complex transformations from simpler ones.

The implementation ensures type consistency using `tuplify` to handle inputs uniformly. Specifically:
- It checks if the two functions are composable by verifying that the domain of the second function matches the codomain of the first, leveraging the `assert_iscomposable` utility.
- If they are composable, it returns a new `Function` instance where the result of applying the current function to any input is passed through `tuplify`, and then the output is fed into the provided `other` function.

**Note**: The use of `tuplify` ensures that all intermediate results are treated as tuples, which helps maintain consistency across operations. This utility function prevents potential errors related to type mismatches in function compositions.

**Output Example**: If you have two functions `f` and `g`, calling `h = f.then(g)` would result in a new function `h` such that `h(x) == g(f(x))`. For example, if `f` is defined as `lambda x: (x + 1,)` and `g` as `lambda y: (y * 2,)`, then `h(3)` would return `(8,)`.
***
### FunctionDef no_type_checking(cls)
**no_type_checking**: The function of no_type_checking is to temporarily disable type checking within a specific context.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
This code snippet implements a context manager named `no_type_checking` that temporarily disables the type-checking mechanism for a class. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Backup**: The function begins by storing the current state of `cls.type_checking` in a temporary variable `tmp`. This ensures that we can revert to the original setting after the context is exited.
2. **Context Management**: Using a `try`-`finally` block, the code creates a context where type-checking is disabled (`cls.type_checking = False`). The `yield` statement allows any code within this function to be executed while in this context.
3. **Recovery of Original State**: Once the execution leaves the context (either by normal completion or an exception), the original state of `cls.type_checking` is restored from the backup stored in `tmp`.

This mechanism ensures that type-checking can be temporarily suspended without permanently altering the class's behavior, making it useful for scenarios where type-checking needs to be bypassed during specific operations.

**Note**: Developers should use this context manager carefully to avoid potential issues arising from disabling type checking. It is particularly useful in testing or development environments where certain operations need to be performed without triggering type checks.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to execute the function on given inputs and ensure type consistency.
**Parameters**:
· xs: A variable number of arguments representing inputs to the function.

**Code Description**: 
The `__call__` method serves as an interface for executing a function with provided input arguments. It first checks if type checking is enabled using the `self.type_checking` attribute. If so, it validates that the number and types of the input arguments match those expected by the function's domain (`dom`). This validation involves ensuring each argument conforms to its expected type within the domain.

If any input does not meet the required type or if the number of inputs is incorrect, a `TypeError` is raised. After validating the inputs, the method proceeds with executing the core functionality of the function on these validated arguments.

Upon execution, the result is then passed through the `tuplify` utility function to ensure it is always returned as a tuple, maintaining consistency in how results are handled across different operations. The output from `tuplify` is what the caller receives.

The method also handles scenarios where no input arguments are provided by defaulting to an empty tuple `()`, ensuring that even functions with optional inputs behave consistently.

**Note**: 
- Ensure type checking (`self.type_checking`) is appropriately configured based on the function's requirements.
- Consistent use of `tuplify` ensures uniformity in result handling, making it easier to manage and integrate different parts of the codebase.
- The method supports both single-element domains and multiple-element domains by validating against the expected domain.

**Output Example**: 
If a function with a domain of `(int, str)` is called with arguments `('hello', 42)`, the output will be `(('hello',), (42,))`. If no arguments are provided, the output will be `()`.
***
### FunctionDef tensor(self, other)
**tensor**: The function of tensor is to perform the parallel composition of two functions.
**Parameters**:
· other: The other function to compose in sequence.

**Code Description**: 
The `tensor` method in the `Function` class allows for the parallel composition of two functions, which are represented by instances of the `Function` class. This operation combines the domains and codomains of the two functions while applying them simultaneously to their respective inputs. The function returns a new `Function` object that encapsulates this combined behavior.

The implementation involves defining an inner function `inside`, which takes a variable number of arguments (`*xs`). These arguments are split into two parts: `left` and `right`. The first part, `left`, is passed to the current instance of the `Function` (i.e., `self`), while the second part, `right`, is passed to the provided `other` function. The results from both functions are then concatenated using `tuplify` and `untuplify` methods.

- **tuplify**: This method converts a value into a tuple if it isn't already one.
- **untuplify**: This method concatenates multiple tuples into a single tuple.

The resulting combined result is returned by the inner function, effectively representing the parallel composition of the two functions.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that the domains and codomains of the two functions match appropriately for the tensor operation to be valid.
2. The `@` operator can be used as an alternative syntax to call this method, allowing for a more readable sequence of function compositions: `f @ g`.

**Output Example**: 
If `f` is a function with domain `[A, B]` and codomain `[X]`, and `g` is a function with domain `[C, D]` and codomain `[Y]`, then the output of `tensor(f, g)` would be a new function that takes inputs in the form `(a, b, c, d)`. The result will first apply `f(a, b)` to produce an intermediate result, and `g(c, d)` to another. These results are concatenated into a single tuple which is returned as the final output of the composed function.

For example:
```python
class Function:
    # ... (other methods)

def f(x, y):
    return x + y

def g(z, w):
    return z * w

result = tensor(f, g)
# result is now a new Function that takes four arguments and returns their sum followed by their product.
```

In this example, the `tensor` method creates a new function that combines the operations of `f` and `g`. When called with inputs `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, it would return the tuple `(3, 12)` representing the results of `f(1, 2)` and `g(3, 4)`.
#### FunctionDef inside
**inside**: The function of inside is to apply a function on two parts of its input based on their domains.
**Parameters**:
· xs: A tuple containing elements that will be split into left and right based on the domain length.

**Code Description**: 
The `inside` function takes in a variable number of arguments (`*xs`) and splits them into two groups based on the length of the domain (`self.dom`). The first part, `left`, consists of the first `len(self.dom)` elements from `xs`. The second part, `right`, contains the remaining elements. The function then applies `self` to `left` and `other` (assumed to be a parameter or variable that is not shown in this snippet) to `right`. The results are concatenated using `tuplify` and `+` operations.

Here’s a detailed analysis:
1. **Splitting the Input**: The function first divides the input arguments into two parts: `left` and `right`. This division is based on the length of `self.dom`, which likely represents the domain of some kind of mathematical or logical operation.
2. **Applying Functions to Parts**: 
   - `self(*left)`: Applies the current function (`self`) to the left part of the input.
   - `other(*right)`: Applies another function (assumed to be provided as a parameter, not shown here) to the right part of the input.
3. **Combining Results**: The results from applying `self` and `other` are then concatenated using the `+` operator, which is expected to work on tuples returned by `tuplify`.
4. **Ensuring Tuple Consistency**: Both parts are passed through `tuplify`, ensuring that even if one part returns a single value (which would be wrapped in a tuple), it remains consistent with how multiple values are handled.

This function plays a crucial role in operations where functions need to be applied separately to different segments of their input, and the results need to be combined. It ensures type consistency by converting all outputs into tuples, which is important for maintaining uniformity across various parts of the project.

**Note**: The `inside` function assumes that there is another function (`other`) being passed or defined elsewhere in the codebase. This parameter is not shown here but must be provided to complete the operation correctly.
**Output Example**: If `self` and `other` are functions that return tuples, and `xs = (1, 2, 3, 4)`, with `self.dom = 2`, then:
- `left = (1, 2)`
- `right = (3, 4)`
- The function would apply `self` to `(1, 2)` and `other` to `(3, 4)`.
- If `self(1, 2) = (5, 6)` and `other(3, 4) = (7, 8)`, the output would be `(5, 6, 7, 8)`.
***
***
### FunctionDef swap(x, y)
**swap**: The function of swap is to create a function that swaps the input types between two tuples.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: x (The tuple of types on the left.)
· parameter2: y (The tuple of types on the right.)

**Code Description**: 
This `swap` function takes in two tuples, `x` and `y`, representing different sets of types. It returns a new `Function` object that internally reorders its input arguments by swapping the elements from `x` to `y` and vice versa.

Here's a detailed analysis:
1. **Inside Function**: The `swap` function defines an inner function called `inside`. This function takes any number of positional arguments (`*xs`), which are expected to be a concatenation of types from both tuples `x` and `y`.
2. **Reordering Logic**: Inside the `inside` function, `tuplify(xs)` converts the input arguments into a tuple, and then it slices this tuple based on the lengths of `x` and `y`. Specifically:
   - The second part of the sliced tuple corresponds to the types in `y` (i.e., `tuplify(xs)[len(x):]`).
   - The first part of the sliced tuple corresponds to the types in `x` (i.e., `tuplify(xs)[:len(x)]`).

3. **Swapping**: These two parts are then concatenated in reverse order (`y + x`) and returned as a new tuple, effectively swapping the positions of the elements from `x` and `y`.

4. **Function Object Creation**: The `inside` function is wrapped into a `Function` object with domain (`dom=x + y`) and codomain (`cod=y + x`). This ensures that the function correctly maps inputs to outputs while preserving type information.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input tuples `x` and `y` are non-empty.
- The types in the tuples should be compatible with the operations being performed within the function.

**Output Example**: 
If `x = (Ty1, Ty2)` and `y = (Ty3, Ty4)`, then calling `swap(x, y)(Ty1, Ty2, Ty3, Ty4)` would return `(Ty3, Ty4, Ty1, Ty2)`.
#### FunctionDef inside
**inside**: The function of inside is to rearrange elements within a tuple by cycling them.
**Parameters**:
· xs: A tuple or any iterable containing elements to be rearranged.

**Code Description**: 
The `inside` function takes an input, which can be any iterable (typically a tuple), and rearranges its elements. It achieves this by using the `tuplify` and `untuplify` functions from the utility module in `discopy/utils.py`. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts `*xs`, allowing for variable-length argument lists, which are then passed to `tuplify`. This ensures that even if multiple arguments are provided, they are treated as a single tuple.
2. **Tuple Transformation**: The input is transformed into a tuple using `tuplify(xs)`. If the input was already a tuple, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it wraps the input in a tuple.
3. **Cycling Elements**: 
   - `tuplify(xs)[len(x):]` extracts elements from the position of the first element in `x` to the end of the tuple.
   - `tuplify(xs)[:len(x)]` extracts elements from the beginning of the tuple up to the position of the first element in `x`.
4. **Concatenation and Return**: The two slices are concatenated, resulting in a new arrangement of elements within the original tuple structure. This rearranged tuple is then passed through `untuplify`, which ensures that if the result has only one element, it returns just that element; otherwise, it returns the entire tuple.

The functional relationship between `inside` and its callees (`tuplify` and `untuplify`) can be understood as follows:
- **tuplify**: Ensures that the input is consistently treated as a tuple. This standardization helps in maintaining type consistency across operations.
- **untuplify**: Processes the rearranged elements to ensure they are returned correctly, either as an individual element or as a tuple, based on their length.

This function plays a crucial role in manipulating and reorganizing elements within tuples for various transformations and compositions. It is particularly useful in scenarios where cyclic permutations of elements need to be applied to maintain certain structural properties.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input provided to `inside` is iterable, as it relies on tuple operations.
- The function assumes that the input contains at least one element; if an empty or non-iterable input is passed, unexpected behavior may occur.

**Output Example**: If `inside((1, 2, 3, 4), (2))` is called, the output will be `(3, 4, 1, 2)`. This demonstrates how elements are cycled to the front based on the position indicated by the second argument.
***
***
### FunctionDef copy(x, n)
**copy**: The function of `copy` is to create multiple copies of a given tuple of types.
**Parameters**:
· `x`: The tuple of types to copy.
· `n`: The number of copies (default value is 2).

**Code Description**: 
The `copy` function takes a tuple of types `x` and an optional parameter `n`, which specifies the number of copies to be made. If no value for `n` is provided, it defaults to making two copies. It returns a new `Function` object that applies the operation of replicating the input types `n` times.

The function uses a lambda function within its definition, which takes any number of arguments (`*xs`) and repeats them `n` times using Python's multiplication operation on tuples. This replicated tuple is then used to construct a new `Function` object with domain `x` and codomain `n * x`. Essentially, this function allows for the creation of multiple parallel versions of a type structure.

The relationship between `copy` and its callers in the project can be seen as follows:
- The `discard` function from the same module calls `copy` with `n=0`, effectively discarding (or making zero copies) of the input types.
- The `trace` method within another class also utilizes `copy`. In a scenario where tracing over some types is required, `copy` helps in creating fixed versions of the traced and non-traced parts, thereby facilitating the manipulation of function domains and codomains.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that the input tuple `x` contains valid type information. The value of `n` should be a positive integer to avoid unexpected behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: If you call `copy((TyA, TyB), 3)`, it will return a new `Function` object whose domain and codomain are both `(TyA, TyB, TyA, TyB, TyA, TyB)`.
***
### FunctionDef discard(dom)
**discard**: The function of discard is to create a `Function` that discards (or makes zero copies) of the input types.

**Parameters**:
· dom: The tuple of types to discard.

**Code Description**: 
The `discard` function takes a single parameter, `dom`, which is expected to be a tuple of types. It returns a new `Function` object where the number of copies made is zero. This effectively means that any input type in `dom` will result in no additional copies being created.

This behavior is achieved by calling another function named `copy` from within `discard`. The `copy` function, which is defined elsewhere in the project, takes a tuple of types and an optional parameter `n`, representing the number of copies to be made. By passing `0` as the value for `n`, `discard` ensures that no additional copies are created.

The relationship between `discard` and its callers in the project can be seen as follows:
- The `trace` method within another class utilizes `discard`. In a scenario where tracing over some types is required, `discard` helps in creating fixed versions of the traced and non-traced parts. Specifically, when calling `self >> self.discard(cod) @ traced`, it ensures that the traced part remains unchanged while discarding any additional copies of the codomain.

**Note**: Ensure that the input tuple `dom` contains valid type information to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If you call `discard((TyA, TyB))`, it will return a new `Function` object whose domain and codomain are both `(TyA, TyB)`.

### FunctionDef ev(base, exponent, left)
**ev**: The function of ev is to evaluate a function by applying it to an argument.
**Parameters**:
· base: The output type.
· exponent: The input type.
· left: Whether to take the function on the left or right.

**Code Description**: The `ev` function in the `Function` class handles the evaluation process of a functional application. It takes two types, `base` and `exponent`, which represent the output and input types respectively. The parameter `left` determines whether the function should be applied from the left or the right.

If `left` is set to `True`, it constructs a domain (`dom`) that combines the exponent type with a function of base and exponent, and sets the codomain (`cod`) as just the base type. It then returns an instance of `Function` that applies the given function `f` to arguments `*xs`.

If `left` is set to `False`, it constructs a domain where the input consists of the exponent type followed by a function from base to exponent, and sets the codomain as just the base type. It then returns an instance of `Function` that applies the last argument `(*xs[-1])` to all preceding arguments `*xs[:-1]`.

The `ev` function is crucial for handling functional application in the context of the `discopy` library, enabling operations like applying a function to its argument based on specified rules.

**Note**: Ensure that the types provided (`base` and `exponent`) are consistent with the expected input and output types. The `left` parameter should be set appropriately depending on the intended application of the function.

**Output Example**: If `ev(base=Ty('int'), exponent=Ty('str'))` is called, it will return a `Function` instance that applies the given function from `int` to `str`, either by applying the function to arguments (if `left=True`) or by applying the last argument to all preceding ones (if `left=False`).
***
### FunctionDef curry(self, n, left)
**curry**: The function of `curry` is to transform a multi-argument function into a sequence of single-argument functions.
**Parameters**: 
· parameter1: n (default value 1)
    - The number of arguments from the right side that are to be curried. This parameter determines how many arguments will be bundled together in each returned function.
· parameter2: left (default value True)
    - A boolean indicating whether to curry on the left or the right. If `True`, it means currying starts from the last argument; if `False`, it means currying starts from the first argument.

**Code Description**: 
The `curry` function is designed to convert a multi-argument function into a sequence of single-argument functions, which can be easier to handle in functional programming. Here’s how it works:

1. **Parameter Handling**: The function accepts two parameters:
   - `n`: This specifies the number of arguments from the right that are to be curried.
   - `left`: A boolean flag indicating whether to curry on the left or the right.

2. **Domain and Codomain Adjustment**:
   - If `left` is `True`, it means we start currying from the rightmost argument. The domain (`dom`) is split into two parts: the first part remains unchanged, and the second part (the last `n` arguments) is combined with the codomain.
   - If `left` is `False`, it means we start currying from the leftmost argument. In this case, the domain is split such that the first `n` arguments are separated, and the remaining arguments along with the codomain form a new function.

3. **Function Construction**:
   - The resulting function has a domain (`dom`) adjusted according to the above rules.
   - Its codomain (`cod`) is modified by exponentiating it with the right part of the original domain if `left` is `True`, or with the left part of the original domain if `left` is `False`.
   - The inside function is constructed in such a way that when called, it will call the original function with arguments appropriately rearranged based on the value of `left`.

4. **Example Usage**:
   ```python
   def curry(self, n=1, left=True) -> Function:
       if left:
           dom = self.dom[:len(self.dom) - n]
           cod = Function.exp(self.cod, self.dom[len(self.dom) - n:])
       else:
           dom, cod = self.dom[n:], Function.exp(self.cod, self.dom[:n])
       return Function(dom=dom, cod=cod, inside=lambda *xs: lambda *ys:
                       self(*(xs + ys) if left else (ys + xs)))
   ```

**Note**: 
- The `uncurry` method should be used to reverse the currying process. This is important for ensuring that the function can be called in its original form after being transformed.
- The `Function.exp` method is assumed to handle exponentiation of types, which is a common operation in type theory and functional programming.

**Output Example**: 
If we have a function `f` with domain `(bool,)` and codomain `(float, complex)`, calling `f.curry(n=1)` will return a new function where the boolean argument can be provided first, followed by both the float and complex arguments. For example:
```python
result = f.curry(n=1)
output = result(True)(3.0, 2+1j)  # This should give the same output as f(True, 3.0)(2+1j)
```

This transformation allows for more flexible function application and chaining in functional programming contexts.
***
### FunctionDef uncurry(self, left)
**uncurry**: The function of uncurry is to transform a function-valued function into a binary function.
· parameter1: left (bool) - Whether to uncurry on the left or right.

**Code Description**: The `uncurry` function plays a pivotal role in manipulating higher-order functions, converting them from functional forms to more straightforward binary operations. This transformation is essential for simplifying complex function compositions and making certain operations more intuitive and easier to handle within the `discopy` framework.

The function first extracts the base and exponent types from the codomain of the input function (`self`). The base type represents the output, while the exponent type(s) represent the input. These are then processed based on whether `left` is set to `True` or `False`.

- If `left` is `True`, it constructs a new domain by appending the exponent type(s) to the function's current domain and sets the codomain as the base type. It then returns a new `Function` instance that applies the original function to its arguments.
- Conversely, if `left` is `False`, it creates a new domain by prepending the exponent type(s) to the function’s current domain and sets the codomain as the base type. The returned `Function` instance still applies the original function but with different argument handling rules.

This dual approach ensures that the function can be adapted for various use cases, making it highly versatile within the library. It is closely integrated with other functions such as `curry`, which allows for seamless switching between curried and uncurried forms of higher-order functions.

**Note**: Ensure that the types extracted from the codomain are consistent with the input and output requirements of the function. The `left` parameter should be set appropriately based on how you intend to apply the transformed function.

**Output Example**: If an `uncurry` call is made with a function that has a domain of `(Ty('int'), Ty('str'))` and a codomain of `Ty('float')`, and `left=True`, it will return a new `Function` instance that applies this operation in a binary form, such as `f(int)(str)`. Conversely, if `left=False`, the same function would be applied but with arguments arranged differently, potentially as `f(str)(int)` depending on how the function is defined.
***
### FunctionDef fix(self, n)
**fix**: The function of fix is to compute the fixed point of a function over a specified number of types.
**parameters**: 
· n : The number of types to take the fixed point over.

**Code Description**: This method computes the parameterised fixed point of a given function `self`. It recursively applies itself until it reaches the base case where `n == 0`, at which point it returns the current function. Otherwise, it constructs a new function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments (`*xs`) and optionally a final argument `y`. The inside method checks if applying the original function to these arguments results in the same value as `y`. If not, it recursively calls itself with the same arguments but updates `y` to be the result of the application. This process effectively finds a fixed point by repeatedly applying the function until convergence.

The relationship between this function and its callers is significant:
- **trace**: The `trace` method uses `fix` as part of its computation, particularly when it constructs the traced version of a function. Specifically, after creating a traced domain (`dom[:-n]`) and codomain (`cod[:-n]`), it applies `fix` to a modified form of the original function (using `discard` and composition). This integration ensures that the fixed point calculation is performed correctly within the context of tracing.

**Note**: When using this method, ensure that the function `self` has a well-defined behavior for repeated application. The choice of `n` should be carefully considered to avoid infinite loops or non-convergence issues.
**Output Example**: If `fix` is called on a function like `Function(lambda x: 1 + 1/x, dom=(float,), cod=(float,)`. For `n=1`, it would compute the fixed point of the function, which approximates the golden ratio `(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2` in this example. The output is a new function that represents this fixed point computation.
#### FunctionDef inside
**inside**: The function of inside is to recursively apply itself until it finds a match or returns a specific value.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: *xs - A variable number of positional arguments (tuple).
· y - An optional single positional argument.

**Code Description**: The `inside` function takes in a variable number of positional arguments (`*xs`) and an optional single positional argument `y`. It recursively calls itself with the updated tuple `(*xs, y)` if `y` is not `None`, or with `(*xs + ())` otherwise. The recursion stops when the result matches `y`, at which point it returns `y`. If no match is found, it continues to call itself until a match occurs.

The function works as follows:
1. It checks if `y` is `None`.
2. If `y` is not `None`, it appends `y` to the tuple `*xs` and calls itself with this updated tuple.
3. If `y` is `None`, it simply passes the original tuple `*xs` without any modifications.
4. It then checks if the result of the recursive call matches `y`.
5. If they match, it returns `y`.
6. Otherwise, it continues to recursively call itself with the same parameters until a match is found.

This function can be used in contexts where you need to find a specific value within a nested tuple structure or perform some operation that requires deep traversal of such structures.

**Note**: Ensure that the input arguments are correctly formatted as tuples when calling this function. Also, note that `y` should ideally be a value that exists within the tuple structure being traversed; otherwise, the recursion may not terminate as expected.

**Output Example**: If we call `inside((1, 2), y=2)`, it will return `2`. However, if we call `inside((1, (2, 3)), y=4)`, it will continue to traverse until it finds a match or exhausts the tuple structure.

### FunctionDef __getitem__(self, key)
**__getitem__**: The function of __getitem__ is to retrieve an item from the dictionary based on the given key.
**Parameters**:
· key: The key used to access the corresponding value in the dictionary.

**Code Description**: 
The `__getitem__` method in this class serves as a special method that allows for dictionary-like indexing, enabling users to retrieve values stored within the instance by using keys. This is achieved through the line `return self.inside[key]`, which directly accesses and returns the value associated with the provided key from the internal dictionary `self.inside`.

**Note**: 
- The method assumes that the key passed in exists within the dictionary; otherwise, a `KeyError` will be raised.
- Ensure that the keys used for accessing values are consistent with those stored in the dictionary to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If you have an instance of this class where `self.inside = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 20}`, calling `instance['apple']` would return `10`.
***
### FunctionDef id(x)
**id**: The function of id is to return a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of an integer from 0 to `x-1` with its corresponding value being the same integer.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: x (int, optional): The upper limit for generating keys and values in the dictionary. Default value is 0.

**Code Description**: 
The function `id` takes an optional integer argument `x`. If no argument is provided or a default value of 0 is given, it returns a dictionary with key-value pairs ranging from 0 to -1 (an empty dictionary). Otherwise, it creates a dictionary where the keys and values are integers starting from 0 up to `x-1`, inclusive. For example, if `x` is provided as 5, the function will return `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.

The dictionary comprehension `{i: i for i in range(x)}` generates a dictionary with keys and values from `range(x)`, which is an iterable that produces integers starting from 0 up to `x-1`. The function then returns this generated dictionary along with the value of `x` as both the minimum and maximum key in the dictionary.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `x` is a non-negative integer. Passing a negative number or a non-integer will result in unexpected behavior.
- The function does not modify any external state; it only returns a new dictionary based on the input parameter.

**Output Example**: 
If you call `id(5)`, the output would be `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`. If you call `id()`, it will return an empty dictionary `{}`.
***
### FunctionDef then(self, other)
**then**: The function of `then` is to transform one dictionary into another by applying the current dictionary's mappings to the values of another dictionary.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: other (Dict)
    - This parameter represents another dictionary whose keys will be used as indices to retrieve corresponding values from the current dictionary, and these values will then be mapped according to the current dictionary’s key-value pairs.

**Code Description**: 
The `then` method takes a second dictionary (`other`) as input and returns a new dictionary. It works by iterating over all keys in `other`. For each key, it uses this key to find its corresponding value in `other`, then looks up this value in the current dictionary (self) to retrieve the mapped value. This process is encapsulated in a dictionary comprehension that constructs a new dictionary (`inside`) with these transformed key-value pairs.

The line of code inside the method:
```python
inside = {i: self[other[i]] for i in range(other.cod)}
```
- `other.cod` refers to the codomain (the set of possible output values) of the dictionary `other`.
- The comprehension iterates over each key in `other`, retrieves its value, and then uses that value as an index into the current dictionary (`self`). The result is a new dictionary where each key from `other` maps to the corresponding mapped value.

Finally, this newly created dictionary is returned by the method:
```python
return Dict(inside, self.dom, other.cod)
```
Here, `Dict` likely refers to a class constructor that takes three arguments: 
- The dictionary of mappings (`inside`), 
- `self.dom`, which presumably represents the domain (the set of input values) of the current dictionary, and 
- `other.cod`, representing the codomain of the other dictionary. 

This ensures that the returned dictionary maintains proper type information.

**Note**: Ensure that both dictionaries involved in this operation have compatible domains and codomains to avoid errors or unexpected behavior during execution.

**Output Example**: If `self` is a dictionary mapping `{0: 'a', 1: 'b'}` with domain 2, and `other` is a dictionary `{0: 1, 1: 0}`, then the output of `then(other)` would be `{0: 'b', 1: 'a'}`.
***
### FunctionDef tensor(self, other)
**tensor**: The function of tensor is to create a new dictionary by combining the contents of two dictionaries based on their codomains.
**parameters**:
· self: An instance of the Dict class representing the first dictionary.
· other: A Dict instance representing the second dictionary.

**Code Description**: This method `tensor` combines the contents of two dictionaries, `self` and `other`, to create a new dictionary. The process involves creating a new dictionary with updated mappings based on the codomains of both input dictionaries.
- Inside the function, it first creates a temporary dictionary `inside` that contains all items from `self`.
- Then, it updates this dictionary by adding key-value pairs from `other`, where keys are adjusted to reflect the combined codomain of `self` and `other`.
- Finally, it returns a new instance of `Dict` with the updated mappings, the combined domain of `self` and `other`, and their combined codomain.

**Note**: Ensure that both input dictionaries have compatible domains; otherwise, this method may not work as intended. Additionally, be mindful of the codomains when combining to avoid conflicts or incorrect mappings.
**Output Example**: If `self = Dict({0: 'a', 1: 'b'})` and `other = Dict({2: 'c', 3: 'd'})`, then calling `tensor(self, other)` would result in a new dictionary where the keys are combined as `{0: 'a', 1: 'b', 3: 'ac', 4: 'ad'}` (assuming some form of concatenation or combination logic is applied to overlapping codomains). The domain and codomain properties of the resulting `Dict` instance would reflect the union of both input dictionaries.
***
### FunctionDef swap(x, y)
**swap**: The function of `swap` is to create a dictionary where elements are rearranged based on their value relative to two given integers.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: x (int) - An integer representing one boundary point used for the swap operation.
· parameter2: y (int) - Another integer representing another boundary point used in conjunction with `x` for the swap logic.

**Code Description**: The function `swap` takes two integers, `x` and `y`, and constructs a dictionary where each key is an integer from 0 to `x + y`. For keys less than `x`, their values are incremented by `x`; otherwise, their values are decremented by `x`. This results in a transformation of the original range such that elements on one side of `x` get shifted up and those on the other side get shifted down.

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty dictionary called `inside`.
2. **Dictionary Construction**: A dictionary comprehension is used to populate `inside`. For each integer `i` in the range from 0 to `x + y`, if `i < x`, then its value in the resulting dictionary will be `i + x`; otherwise, it will be `i - x`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new `Dict` object containing the constructed dictionary `inside`, along with both `x` and `y` as additional attributes.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `x` and `y` are non-negative integers since negative values could lead to unexpected behavior.
- The function assumes that `x` is less than or equal to `x + y` to avoid division by zero errors when creating the dictionary comprehension, although this condition is not explicitly checked within the function.

**Output Example**: If `swap(3, 5)` is called, the output might look like:
```python
{'0': 3, '1': 4, '2': 5, '3': 6, '4': 5, '5': 4}
```
Here, for keys less than 3 (i.e., `0`, `1`, and `2`), their values are incremented by 3. For keys greater than or equal to 3 (i.e., `3`, `4`, and `5`), their values are decremented by 3.
***
### FunctionDef copy(x, n)
**copy**: The function of `copy` is to create a new dictionary with keys ranging from 0 to n*x-1, where each key's value is its remainder when divided by x.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `x`: An integer that defines the divisor used in calculating the values.
· parameter2: `n`: An optional integer defaulting to 2. It determines the range of keys in the resulting dictionary (0 to n*x-1).

**Code Description**: 
The function `copy` takes two parameters, `x` and `n`. The parameter `x` is an integer used as a divisor for the values generated within the new dictionary. The second parameter `n`, with a default value of 2, specifies how many times larger than `x` the range of keys should be (i.e., the number of elements in the sequence from 0 to n*x-1). 

The function returns a new instance of `Dict` where each key within the specified range is mapped to its remainder when divided by `x`. This means for any key `i`, the value will be `i % x`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `n` and `x` are positive integers; otherwise, unexpected behavior may occur.
- The function creates a dictionary where keys start from 0 up to n*x-1. If `n` is not provided or set to 2 by default, the range will be from 0 to 2*x-1.

**Output Example**: 
If you call `copy(x=3, n=2)`, it returns a dictionary where keys are in the range of 0 to 5 (since 2 * 3 = 6), and their values are the remainder when divided by 3. The output would be `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 2}`.

If you call `copy(x=4)`, it will use the default value of `n` which is 2. Thus, keys range from 0 to 7 (since 2 * 4 = 8), and their values are the remainder when divided by 4. The output would be `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 3}`.

## Class Methods

### `__init__(self, data: list) -> None:`

**Description:** 
The constructor method initializes an instance of `DataProcessor` with a list of raw data items.

**Parameters:**
- `data (list)`: A list containing the initial set of raw data items to be processed.

**Returns:**
- `None`

### `clean_data(self) -> list:`

**Description:** 
Cleans the input data by removing null or invalid entries. This method ensures that only valid and non-null data items are retained for further processing.

**Parameters:**
- No additional parameters required.

**Returns:**
- `list`: A cleaned list of data items with no null or invalid entries.

### `validate_data(self) -> bool:`

**Description:** 
Validates the cleaned data against predefined rules to ensure it meets specific criteria. This method checks for consistency and completeness before proceeding with further processing steps.

**Parameters:**
- No additional parameters required.

**Returns:**
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the data is valid, otherwise returns `False`.

### `format_data(self) -> dict:`

**Description:** 
Formats the validated data into a structured dictionary for easier access and use in subsequent processing or analysis steps. This method ensures that the data is organized in a way that facilitates further operations.

**Parameters:**
- No additional parameters required.

**Returns:**
- `dict`: A structured dictionary containing the formatted data.

## Example Usage

```python
# Sample raw data
raw_data = ["John Doe", None, "Jane Smith", "", "Alice Johnson"]

processor = DataProcessor(raw_data)
cleaned_data = processor.clean_data()
valid = processor.validate_data()
formatted_data = processor.format_data()

print("Cleaned Data:", cleaned_data)
print("Validation Result:", valid)
print("Formatted Data:", formatted_data)
```

## Notes

- The `DataProcessor` class is designed to be flexible and can handle various types of data, including strings, numbers, and other complex objects.
- Ensure that the raw data passed during initialization is a list. Non-list inputs will result in an error.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how to use the `DataProcessor` class for processing and transforming data effectively.
