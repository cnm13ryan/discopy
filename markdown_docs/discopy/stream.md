### Object: `CustomerOrder`

#### Overview

The `CustomerOrder` object is a fundamental component of our e-commerce system, designed to manage and track all customer orders placed through the platform. This object plays a critical role in ensuring that orders are processed accurately and efficiently, from initial placement to fulfillment.

#### Fields

- **orderID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **customerID**: The ID of the customer who placed the order.
- **productIDs**: An array containing the IDs of products ordered by the customer.
- **quantityOrdered**: Array indicating the quantity of each product in the order.
- **orderDate**: Date and time when the order was placed.
- **estimatedDeliveryDate**: Estimated date for delivery of the order.
- **status**: Current status of the order (e.g., "Pending", "Processing", "Shipped", "Delivered").
- **totalAmount**: Total amount charged to the customer for this order.

#### Methods

- **placeOrder()**: Initiates the creation and submission of a new order. This method requires valid `customerID`, `productIDs`, and `quantityOrdered` as parameters.
  
  ```plaintext
  Parameters:
    - customerID: Integer
    - productIDs: Array of Integers
    - quantityOrdered: Array of Integers
  
  Returns:
    - Boolean indicating success or failure of the order placement.
  ```

- **updateOrderStatus(newStatus) [Protected]**: Updates the status of an existing order. This method is typically called by internal processes and not directly accessible to external users.

  ```plaintext
  Parameters:
    - newStatus: String representing the new status (e.g., "Shipped", "Delivered").
  
  Returns:
    - Boolean indicating success or failure of the status update.
  ```

- **getOrderDetails()**: Retrieves detailed information about a specific order. This method is used for administrative and customer service purposes.

#### Example Usage

```plaintext
// Placing a new order
let result = CustomerOrder.placeOrder(12345, [1001, 1002], [2, 1]);

if (result) {
    console.log("Order placed successfully.");
} else {
    console.log("Failed to place the order.");
}

// Retrieving details of an existing order
let orderDetails = CustomerOrder.getOrderDetails(67890);
console.log(orderDetails);
```

#### Notes

- Ensure all fields are properly validated before invoking `placeOrder()` to avoid processing errors.
- The `status` field is managed internally and should not be modified directly by external users.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `CustomerOrder` object, its fields, methods, and usage examples.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, now, _later)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of Ty with either a base value or a later callable that returns a Ty[base] type.
**parameters**: 
· now: A base value or None, representing the initial state or value for the Ty instance. If it is not a tuple and the base is a tuple, now will be converted to a tuple.
· _later: A callable that takes no arguments and returns a Ty[base] type, which can be used later to generate the Ty instance.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method of the `Ty` class in `discopy/stream.py` is responsible for setting up the initial state of an object. It handles two main scenarios: when initializing with a direct value (`now`) and when using a deferred initialization mechanism via a callable (`_later`).

1. **Initialization with Direct Value**:
   - The method first checks if the `base` attribute of the current instance is a tuple using `is_tuple`. If it is, and `now` is not already a tuple or None, it converts `now` to a tuple.
   - It then ensures that `now` is either an instance of the type specified by the base (or its parameterized version) or None. If `now` is None, it initializes `now` with a call to `self.base()`, which creates an instance of the base type using the default constructor. Otherwise, it uses `now` directly.
   - The method assigns the validated `now` value and the `_later` callable (if provided) to the corresponding attributes of the instance.

2. **Initialization with Deferred Callable**:
   - If a `_later` callable is provided, it remains as-is without any conversion or validation. This allows for lazy initialization where the Ty instance can be created at a later time using the callable.

The use of `is_tuple` and `get_origin` ensures that the method can handle both simple types (like integers) and parameterized types (like `Tuple[int, str]`) consistently. By validating and converting inputs appropriately, it maintains type safety and flexibility in how Ty instances are initialized.

**Note**: Ensure that the base type specified during initialization supports parameterization if a tuple is involved to avoid unexpected behavior. Also, be mindful of the `_later` callable's return type as it must match `Ty[base]`.

***
### FunctionDef singleton(cls, x)
**singleton**: The function of `singleton` is to construct a stream where `x` represents the current time step and an empty stream represents the future time steps.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `cls`, which refers to the class calling this method.
· parameter2: `x: base`, representing the object at the current time step.

**Code Description**: 
The `singleton` function is a static method that constructs a new instance of the `Ty` class, representing a stream. It takes an object `x` as input and returns a new `Ty` object with two attributes:
- `now`: The value `x` at the current time step.
- `_later`: A lambda function that returns an empty `Ty` instance (`Ty()`), symbolizing the future time steps.

This method is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to define a stream with a single element at the present and no elements in the future. The example provided demonstrates how to use this method:
```python
XY = Ty.singleton(symmetric.Ty('x', 'y'))
```
Here, `XY` represents a stream that contains `'x' @ 'y'` now and is empty for all subsequent time steps.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input object `x` is of type `base`, as specified by the function signature.
- The use of lambdas for `_later` ensures that future time steps are always represented by an empty stream, maintaining consistency in the stream's structure.

**Output Example**: When you call `Ty.singleton(symmetric.Ty('x', 'y'))`, the output will be a new `Ty` instance with:
```python
XY.now  # Output: x @ y
XY.later.now  # Output: Ty()
XY.later.later.now  # Output: Ty()
```
This example illustrates how the current time step contains `'x' @ 'y'`, while all future time steps are empty.
***
### FunctionDef delay(self)
**delay**: The function of delay is to pre-allocate the unit type before the current type in a stream.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `delay` method returns a new `Ty` instance with the base type being the unit type, and a lambda function that returns the original `Ty` instance. Essentially, it delays or postpones the application of the current type by including an initial unit type. This is useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that certain operations are performed after a default or identity operation.

In the context of the project, this method is used in various parts of the codebase. For example, in `Stream.feedback`, it ensures that feedback loops can be correctly initialized and tracked by adding an initial delay when necessary. Additionally, in the test case for Python streams (`test_python_stream`), `delay` is utilized to create a sequence where types are properly ordered with units.

The method works as follows:
1. It creates a new instance of `Ty` using the unit type.
2. A lambda function is attached that returns the original `Ty` instance when called later.
3. This effectively delays the application of the current type by one step, ensuring that operations are correctly sequenced and tracked.

**Note**: Ensure that the delay operation is consistent with the overall structure of your data types to avoid any logical inconsistencies in your stream processing logic.

**Output Example**: 
```python
XY = Ty(symmetric.Ty('x', 'y')).delay()
for x in [XY.now, XY.later.now, XY.later.later.now]: print(x)
# Output:
Ty()
x @ y
x @ y
```
This example demonstrates how the `delay` method delays the application of the type by one step, ensuring that the initial unit type is correctly applied before any other types.
***
### FunctionDef sequence(cls, x, n_steps)
**sequence**: The function of sequence is to construct a stream of objects based on an initial base type.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: x (of type `base`)
    - This represents the initial base type from which the sequence will be generated.
· parameter2: n_steps (of type `int`, default value 0)
    - This optional parameter determines how many steps ahead in the sequence to generate. If not provided, it defaults to generating just the current step.

**Code Description**: The function `sequence` is designed to create a stream of objects by recursively applying itself. It constructs an object that represents the current step and a method `_later` that will return the next step in the sequence when called.
1. **Initialization**: A new object representing the "now" state is created using the current value of `n_steps`. This is achieved by summing up base types with incremented indices based on `n_steps`.
2. **Recursive Construction**: The `_later` method returns another instance of `sequence`, but this time with `n_steps + 1`. This ensures that each call to `_later()` will generate the next step in the sequence.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, an object is returned that encapsulates both the current state and a way to access future states through the `_later` method.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that `cls.base` can be called with a string argument to create new base types.
- The use of `sum` in this context concatenates multiple base types into a single object, which is then used as part of the constructed Ty instance.
- The `_later` method is crucial for creating a lazy evaluation mechanism where each step in the sequence can be accessed on-demand.

**Output Example**: 
```python
XY = Ty.sequence(symmetric.Ty('x', 'y'))
print(XY.now)  # Output: x0 @ y0
print(XY.later.now)  # Output: x1 @ y1
print(XY.later.later.now)  # Output: x2 @ y2
```

This example demonstrates how the `sequence` function constructs a series of base types with incremented indices, allowing for lazy access to each step in the sequence.
***
### FunctionDef unroll(self)
**unroll**: The function of `unroll` is to transform a stream into a sequence of tensor products.
**Parameters**: 
· None: The method does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `unroll` method within the `Ty` class is designed to process and manipulate streams. Specifically, it takes an infinite stream represented by `x0, x1, x2, ...` and converts it into a sequence where each element is the tensor product of the current element with all subsequent elements in the stream. The resulting structure represents the evolution of the initial data through time or steps.

The method works as follows:
1. **Initial Check**: It first checks if `self.is_constant` returns `True`. If so, it directly returns `self`, meaning that if the stream is constant (i.e., all elements are identical), no further processing is needed.
2. **Recursive Call**: If the stream is not constant, it recursively calls itself to process the "tail" of the stream (`self.later.now`), effectively moving one step forward in the sequence.

The method then constructs a new `Ty` object by combining the current element with the result of processing the tail using the lambda function provided. This lambda function ensures that further unrolling is possible, maintaining the structure and behavior of the original stream.

**Note**: 
- The method assumes that the `Ty` class has methods `is_constant`, `now`, and `later` defined within it.
- The use of a lambda function in the construction of the new `Ty` object ensures that the unrolling process can continue indefinitely, handling infinite streams efficiently.
- This method is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be processed step-by-step over an infinite sequence.

**Output Example**: 
If we have a stream represented by `x0`, `unroll` would transform it into `x0 @ x1`. If the stream continues with `x2, x3, ...`, subsequent calls would yield:
- For `x1`: `x1 @ x2`
- For `x2`: `x2 @ x3`

This process effectively captures the evolution of data over a sequence of steps.

### FunctionDef delay(self)
**delay**: The function of delay is to shift the stream by one time step, essentially creating a delayed version of the current stream.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters as it operates on the instance itself.
· self: The instance of the Stream class that this method belongs to.

**Code Description**: 
The `delay` method in the `Stream` class is responsible for delaying the stream by one time step. It achieves this by processing each component (domain, codomain, memory) of the current stream and applying a delay operation to them as well. This ensures that when the delayed stream is used, it effectively represents data from the future relative to the original stream.

1. **Processing Components**: The method first delays all components (`self.dom`, `self.cod`, `self.mem`) by one time step using list comprehension: `[x.delay() for x in (self.dom, self.cod, self.mem)]`. This means each component is transformed into its delayed version.
2. **Creating Delayed Identity Function**: It then creates two functions:
   - `now`: Represents the current state of memory (`self.mem.now`).
   - `_later`: A lambda function that returns the current instance of `Stream`, indicating a future state equivalent to the present one.
3. **Constructing New Stream Instance**: Finally, it constructs a new `Stream` object using these components and the delayed identity function: `type(self)(now, dom, cod, mem, _later)`.

**Note**: The delay operation is crucial for modeling temporal shifts in data streams, which can be useful in various applications such as signal processing or time series analysis. Ensure that the category (`self.category`) supports these operations to avoid any runtime errors.

**Output Example**: If `stream_obj` is an instance of `Stream`, calling `delayed_stream = stream_obj.delay()` results in a new `Stream` object where each component (domain, codomain, memory) has been delayed by one time step. The `_later` function ensures that the delayed state represents the current state (`now`) of the original stream.

### FunctionDef then(self, other)
**then**: The function of `then` is to compose two streams by swapping their memories.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: self (Stream) - The current stream instance on which the method is called.
· parameter2: other (Stream) - Another stream to be composed with the current one.

**Code Description**: 
The `then` method performs a composition of two streams, `self` and `other`, by swapping their memories. This operation is designed to align the outputs of the first stream (`self`) with the inputs of the second stream (`other`). The process involves multiple steps:

1. **Memory Swapping**: A swap operation is performed on the categories' arrows using `self.category.ar.swap`.
2. **Intermediate Computation**: An intermediate value `now` is computed by combining the current state of `self` and the domain of `other`.
3. **Composition Steps**:
   - The first step involves shifting the computation to align with the codomain of `other` and swapping memories.
   - Next, it shifts back to the domain of `self` while maintaining memory alignment.
   - Finally, another shift is applied to ensure proper alignment for further composition.
4. **Domain, Codomain, and Memory Computation**: The domains (`dom`), codomains (`cod`), and combined memories (`mem`) are determined based on the properties of both streams.
5. **Later Function Handling**: If either stream is constant (i.e., does not depend on any input), a later function `_later` is set to `None`. Otherwise, it is defined as a lambda function that composes the later functions of both streams.

6. **Return Value**: A new `Stream` instance is returned with updated properties (`now`, `dom`, `cod`, and `mem`) and an optional later function `_later`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the categories' arrows are compatible for swapping.
- The method assumes that the streams can be composed in a meaningful way, i.e., the codomain of one stream matches the domain of the other.

**Output Example**: 
Given two streams `f` and `g` as defined in the example:
```python
x, y, z, m, n = map(Ty.sequence, "xyzmn")
f = Stream.sequence("f", x, y, m)
g = Stream.sequence("g", y, z, n)
result_stream = (f >> g).now
```
The `result_stream` will be a new stream that represents the composition of `f` and `g`, with appropriate memory handling. The diagram generated by `(f >> g).now.draw(path="docs/_static/stream/stream-then.png")` visually represents this composition, showing how memories are swapped during the process.
***
### FunctionDef tensor(self, other)
**tensor**: The function of tensor is to compute the tensor product of two streams, effectively swapping their memories.
· parameter1: self - An instance of the Stream class representing one stream.
· parameter2: other - An instance of the Stream class representing another stream.

**Code Description**: This method computes the tensor product of two given streams by performing a specific memory swap operation. The tensor product is a fundamental concept in category theory, where it represents a way to combine two morphisms (in this case, streams) into a single morphism.

1. **assert_isinstance(other, Stream)**: Before proceeding with the computation, the method first ensures that `other` is an instance of the `Stream` class using the `assert_isinstance` function. This check prevents potential errors by ensuring type correctness.
2. **swap = self.category.ar.swap**: The method retrieves the swap operation from the category associated with the current stream (`self`). This swap operation will be used to rearrange memories in the resulting tensor product.
3. **now = self.dom.now @ swap(other.dom.now, self.mem_dom) @ other.mem_dom**: Here, the method constructs the domain of the new stream by applying the memory swap operation to the domains and codomains of both streams. This step ensures that the memories are correctly rearranged when combining the two streams.
4. **now >>= self.now @ other.now**: The method then combines the current data (`self.now` and `other.now`) into the domain of the new stream, creating a more complex structure for the tensor product.
5. **now >>= self.cod.now @ swap(self.mem_cod, other.cod.now) @ other.mem_cod**: Similarly, the codomain is constructed by applying the memory swap operation to the memories and combining the current data.
6. **dom = self.dom @ other.dom**: The domain of the resulting stream is created by concatenating the domains of both input streams.
7. **cod = self.cod @ other.cod**: The codomain of the resulting stream is also concatenated from the codomains of the input streams.
8. **mem = self.mem @ other.mem**: The memories are combined, maintaining their structure but rearranged as needed by the swap operation.
9. **output = ...**: Finally, the method constructs the output stream with the updated domain, codomain, and memory.

**Note**: Ensure that both input streams (`self` and `other`) have compatible structures for the tensor product to be well-defined. The use of memory swap operations is crucial for rearranging data correctly in the combined structure.

**Output Example**: For two streams A and B with domains D_A, D_B and codomains C_A, C_B, the resulting tensor product stream will have a domain (D_A × D_B), a codomain (C_A × C_B), and memories that are appropriately rearranged according to the swap operation.

#### FunctionDef _later
**_later**: The function of `_later` is to return the feedback of the current stream's tail or `self` if the stream is constant.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `_later` method serves as a recursive mechanism that helps in handling streams, particularly when determining the behavior at the end of a data processing sequence. It checks whether the current stream object (`self`) is marked as `is_constant`. If it is not constant, `_later()` calls itself to continue evaluating the tail of the stream; otherwise, it returns `self`.

This method plays a crucial role in managing the flow and structure of streams within the `Stream` class. By recursively checking for the `is_constant` attribute, `_later` ensures that the feedback mechanism is applied only when necessary, maintaining the integrity of constant streams without unnecessary computations.

The `_later` function interacts with other methods such as `feedback`, which likely handles the actual feedback logic based on the stream's state. The `Ty.later`, `cod.later`, and `mem.later` are placeholders that represent specific types or configurations for handling the tail of the stream, ensuring that the feedback mechanism is tailored to the current context.

**Note**: Ensure that the `is_constant` attribute correctly identifies constant streams to avoid infinite recursion. This method should be used in scenarios where dynamic tail behavior needs to be evaluated based on the state of the stream.

**Output Example**: 
If the current stream object is not constant, `_later()` might return an instance of a feedback mechanism configured with specific types (`Ty.later`, `cod.later`, and `mem.later`). If the stream is constant, it will simply return the current stream object. For example:
```python
# Assuming the current stream is not constant
result = self._later()  # Returns an instance of the feedback mechanism

# Assuming the current stream is constant
result = self._later()  # Returns self
```
***
***
## ClassDef Category
**Category**: The function of Category is to serve as a syntactic sugar wrapper around `Category(Ty[category.ob], Stream[category])`.
**Attributes**: 
· ob: Represents the object type within the category.
· ar: Represents the arrow type or morphism between objects in the category.

**Code Description**: The `Category` class inherits from `symmetric.Category` and is designed to provide a more convenient interface for working with categories in the context of stream processing. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**:
   - The constructor takes two optional parameters: `ob` (object) and `ar` (arrow).
   - If no object type is provided, it defaults to `Ty`, which likely represents a generic type for objects in the category.
   - Similarly, if no arrow type is specified, it defaults to `Stream[category]`, indicating that arrows are represented by streams within this category.

2. **Default Argument Handling**:
   - The constructor checks whether the provided types (`ob` and `ar`) are `None`. If they are, default values of `Ty` and `Stream[category]` are used respectively.
   - This ensures flexibility in creating instances where specific types need to be explicitly defined or left as defaults.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - The class inherits from `symmetric.Category`, which likely provides a foundation for category theory operations, ensuring that the methods and attributes of this base class are available.
   
4. **Usage Context**:
   - In the project, the `Category` class is used in conjunction with stream processing to handle categorical structures. For example, it is utilized in defining functors (`test_functor_python_stream`, `test_walk`, `test_fibonacci`) that map between different categories and streams.
   - The `Category` helps in encapsulating complex category-theoretic operations into a more manageable form, making the code easier to read and maintain.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that you have imported the necessary modules (`Ty`, `Stream`, etc.) from their respective sources. Additionally, be mindful of how the default types are used; if specific types are required for your application, explicitly define them in the constructor call.

#### Notes

- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive data such as `PasswordHash` is handled securely and never exposed.
- **Permissions**: Users with higher roles may have additional permissions, including the ability to manage other users.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `User` object's structure and usage within the application.
