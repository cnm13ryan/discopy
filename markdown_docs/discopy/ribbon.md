## ClassDef Diagram
**Diagram**: The function of Diagram is to represent a ribbon diagram, which is both a pivotal diagram and a balanced diagram.
**Attributes**:
· inside: The layers of the diagram.
· dom (pivotal.Ty): The domain of the diagram, i.e., its input.
· cod (pivotal.Ty): The codomain of the diagram, i.e., its output.

**Code Description**: This class extends pivotal.Diagram and balanced.Diagram to represent a ribbon diagram. A ribbon diagram is a special type of diagram that combines properties from both pivotal diagrams and balanced diagrams. The Diagram class includes methods for performing operations specific to ribbon diagrams, such as tracing wires and composing with cups. It also provides functionality for converting the diagram into a dual-rail representation.

The `trace` method allows you to trace over specified numbers of wires in the diagram. If `left` is set to True, it traces from left to right; otherwise, it traces from right to left. This operation involves rearranging and combining parts of the diagram using caps and cups, which are fundamental operations in ribbon diagrams.

The `cup` method post-composes a cup between specified wires by introducing braid operations. This ensures that the resulting diagram maintains the properties required for a ribbon diagram while allowing for specific interactions between wires.

The `to_ribbons` method converts every object within the diagram to its dual-rail representation, effectively doubling each object and moving twists to braids. This transformation is useful in certain quantum computing applications where such representations are necessary.

**Note**: When using the `trace` method, ensure that the specified number of wires (`n`) does not exceed the length of the input or output layers. Incorrect indices will result in a ValueError.

**Output Example**: Calling `diagram.to_ribbons()` on a diagram with two objects would result in each object being doubled and its twist moved to a braid, effectively creating a dual-rail representation of the original diagram. For instance, if the original diagram had objects `x` and `y`, the output would resemble `x @ x` and `y @ y`, where the twists associated with these objects are now part of their respective braids.
### FunctionDef trace(self, n, left)
**trace**: The function of `trace` is to perform the trace operation on a ribbon diagram by tracing specified numbers of wires.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: n (integer) - The number of wires to be traced. If not provided, it defaults to 1.
· parameter2: left (boolean) - A flag indicating whether to perform the trace from the left side (default is False).

**Code Description**: 
The `trace` function performs a specific operation on a ribbon diagram by tracing a specified number of wires based on the given parameters. The function handles two main cases depending on the value and boolean flag provided.

1. **If no wires are to be traced (`n=0`)**: In this case, the function simply returns the original diagram without any modification.
2. **For non-zero `n`**: 
    - If the `left` parameter is set to True, the function performs a left trace operation:
        1. It first applies caps on the first `n` wires of the domain and then concatenates it with the remaining part of the diagram (`self.dom[n:]`). This step effectively "closes" the traced wires.
        2. Then, it concatenates this modified diagram with the original diagram (`self`).
        3. Finally, it applies cups on the first `n` wires of the codomain and then concatenates it with the remaining part of the codomain (`self.cod[n:]`). This step "opens" the traced wires in a way that maintains the overall structure.
    - If the `left` parameter is set to False (default), the function performs a right trace operation:
        1. It first removes the last `n` wires from the domain and then applies caps on these removed wires.
        2. Then, it concatenates this modified diagram with the original diagram (`self`).
        3. Finally, it removes the last `n` wires from the codomain and then applies cups on these removed wires.

In both cases, the function ensures that the traced wires are properly closed or opened while maintaining the integrity of the ribbon diagram structure.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the number of wires to be traced (`n`) does not exceed the total number of wires in the domain.
- The `left` parameter should be set according to whether you want to trace from the left side (closing the front end) or the right side (opening the back end).

**Output Example**: 
For a diagram with 5 wires, if we call `trace(2)` and `trace(2, left=True)`, the output will reflect the tracing operation on the first two wires according to the specified method. The exact return value would depend on the initial state of the diagram but typically involves reconfiguring the connections between traced and untraced parts of the diagram.
***
### FunctionDef cup(self, x, y)
**cup**: The function of cup is to post-compose a ribbon diagram by introducing braids between specified wires.
**parameters**: 
· i: The wire on the left of the cup.
· j: The wire on the right of the cup.

**Code Description**: The `cup` method in the `Diagram` class performs the operation of post-composing a ribbon diagram with a cup between two specified wires, `i` and `j`. It ensures that the indices provided are within valid range by checking if they fall between 0 and the length of the codomain (`self.cod`). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.

The method first determines which index is smaller and larger to ensure that the braid operations are performed correctly. For each wire from `i` to `j-1`, it creates a braid using the `braid_factory` method and composes it into the diagram by shifting the parts of the codomain accordingly.

After all braids have been introduced, it constructs the cup between wires `j-1` and `j` using the `cup_factory` method. Finally, it returns the updated diagram with the cup composition applied.

The `cup` method is called in the test function `test_cup_chaining` to demonstrate how chaining multiple cups can transform a given diagram into an expected one. This helps illustrate the practical usage of the `cup` method within the context of creating complex ribbon diagrams.

**Note**: Ensure that the indices provided for the cup operation are valid, i.e., they should be non-negative integers and less than the length of the codomain (`self.cod`). Invalid indices will result in a `ValueError`.

**Output Example**: The output would be an updated `Diagram` object with the specified cups and braids applied. For instance, if you call `diagram = (A @ V @ B).cup(1, 5)`, it might return a diagram where `V` has been transformed by introducing appropriate braids between wires 1 and 4, followed by applying a cup between wires 4 and 5.
***
### FunctionDef to_ribbons(self)
**to_ribbons**: The function of `to_ribbons` is to double every object and send the twist to the braid.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it operates on the current instance of the Diagram class.
**Code Description**: 
The `to_ribbons` method transforms a diagram by applying a specific functor, known as `DualRail`, which handles twists within the diagram. Here’s how it works:

1. **Twist Handling**: If an object in the diagram is identified as a `Twist`, the `DualRail` functor converts this twist into a braid that represents the same operation but in a different form. Specifically, for each `Twist` with domain and codomain `x`, it creates a braid of the form \( x \otimes x \), effectively doubling the object.

2. **Braid Construction**: For a `Twist` between two objects, say \( x \) and \( y \), the method constructs a braid that swaps these objects in a way that is consistent with the original twist but now represented as a braid operation. This transformation ensures that the diagram can be interpreted differently while preserving its overall structure.

3. **General Objects**: For any other type of object, the `DualRail` functor simply passes through unchanged using the inherited behavior from the parent class.

4. **Implementation Details**:
    - The `DualRail` functor is defined as a subclass of `Functor`.
    - It overrides the `__call__` method to handle twists specifically.
    - For a twist, it creates two braids that perform the same operation but in a balanced form (i.e., using the `@` operator for tensor product).
    - The functor also includes a default implementation for other types of objects.

5. **Example Usage**:
   ```python
   x = Ty('x')
   braided_twist = Diagram.twist(x).to_ribbons()
   ```
   This code snippet creates a twist diagram and then applies the `to_ribbons` method to convert it into a braid representation, as shown in the image: `/static/balanced/twist_dual_rail.png`.

**Note**: The transformation ensures that any twist within the diagram is reinterpreted as a balanced braid operation. This can be particularly useful for visualizing and manipulating diagrams in a more structured manner.

**Output Example**: The `to_ribbons` method returns a new diagram where each twist has been converted into a corresponding braid, effectively doubling the objects involved in the original twists. For instance, if the input is a twist between two objects \( x \) and \( y \), the output will be a braid that swaps these objects using tensor products.
#### ClassDef DualRail
**DualRail**: The function of DualRail is to apply specific transformations based on the type of input it receives.
**Code Description**: 
The `DualRail` class inherits from the `Functor` class and implements a method that performs different operations depending on the type of input provided. Specifically, if the input is an instance of the `Twist` class, it constructs a `Braid` object with the same domain as the `Twist` and returns a composition of two identical braids. Otherwise, it falls back to the default behavior defined by the parent `Functor` class.

```python
class DualRail(Functor):
    def __call__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Twist):
            braid = Braid(other.dom, other.dom)
            return braid >> braid  # Compose two identical braids
        return super().__call__(other)  # Delegate to the parent Functor's implementation
```

- **Attributes**: The `DualRail` class does not define any additional attributes beyond those inherited from its parent classes. It relies on the methods and attributes provided by the `Functor` class, which includes handling mappings between objects and diagrams.

**Note**: When using the `DualRail` class, ensure that you have instances of the `Twist` class available for testing the specific transformation logic. Additionally, be aware that any other input will be handled according to the default behavior defined by the parent `Functor` class.

**Output Example**: If a `Twist` object with a domain of 2 is passed to an instance of `DualRail`, it would return a `Diagram` representing the composition of two identical braids on that domain. For example:

```python
# Assuming Twist and Braid are defined elsewhere in the codebase
twist = Twist(2)
dual_rail_instance = DualRail()
output = dual_rail_instance(twist)  # Returns a Diagram composed of two identical braids with domain 2
```

The output would be a `Diagram` where two identical braids, each acting on the domain 2, are concatenated.

## ClassDef Cup
**Cup**: The function of Cup is to represent a pivotal cup in a ribbon diagram.
**Attributes**: 
· left (pivotal.Ty): The atomic type on the left side of the cup.
· right (pivotal.Ty): The adjoint atomic type on the right side of the cup.

**Code Description**: The `Cup` class is designed to model a pivotal cup in a ribbon diagram, inheriting from both `pivotal.Cup` and `Box`. This dual inheritance allows it to leverage functionalities from both classes while maintaining its specific role within the ribbon diagram framework. A pivotal cup represents a fundamental morphism that connects two atomic types, symbolizing a kind of "fusion" or "coalescence" between them.

The class is defined with parameters for `left` and `right`, which are expected to be instances of `pivotal.Ty`. These parameters represent the input and output types associated with the cup, respectively. The `__ambiguous_inheritance__` attribute indicates that there might be potential ambiguities or conflicts in its inheritance structure, suggesting a need for careful handling during method resolution.

In the project, the `Cup` class is referenced by the `Polynomial` class within the `test_Kauffman/Polynomial/braid` module. Specifically, it appears in the definition of the `braid` function where instances of `Cup` are used to construct braids and polynomial expressions involving boxes and diagrams.

**Note**: When using the `Cup` class, ensure that the types passed for `left` and `right` parameters are correctly defined as `pivotal.Ty`. Additionally, be aware of any potential ambiguities in its inheritance hierarchy, which might require explicit method resolution or custom overrides to avoid conflicts.
## ClassDef Cap
**Cap**: The function of Cap is to represent a pivotal cap in a ribbon diagram.
**Attributes**: 
· left (pivotal.Ty): The atomic type on one side of the cap.
· right (pivotal.Ty): The atomic type on the other side, which is its adjoint.

**Code Description**: The `Cap` class inherits from both `pivotal.Cap` and `Box`, making it a pivotal and balanced box in a ribbon diagram. This means that `Cap` objects can be used to represent connections between different types within the context of ribbon diagrams, ensuring that the diagram maintains certain properties like being pivotal (having an adjoint for each type) and balanced (each type has a corresponding adjoint).

In the project, `Cap` is referenced in the `test_Kauffman/Polynomial/braid` function, where it appears alongside other components such as `A`, `Cup`, and `Cup(x, y) >> A.dagger() >> Cap(x, y)`. This usage suggests that `Cap` is used to create specific diagrammatic expressions involving braids and cups, which are fundamental elements in the study of ribbon diagrams and their applications in knot theory and quantum computing.

The `Cap` class plays a crucial role in defining complex diagrams by connecting different types through its adjoint properties. Its implementation ensures that these connections adhere to the rules governing pivotal and balanced categories within the context of ribbon diagrams, making it an essential building block for constructing more intricate diagrammatic expressions.

**Note**: When using the `Cap` class, ensure that the types passed as parameters are correctly defined and adhered to the rules of the ribbon category. The adjoint relationship between `left` and `right` types must be respected in all operations involving `Cap`. Additionally, understanding the broader context within which `Cap` is used (such as its role in creating braids) will help in effectively utilizing it for constructing meaningful diagrams.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return a new Braid object by rotating the current instance's codomain.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (boolean) - A flag indicating whether to perform a specific type of rotation, although it is currently not used in the implementation.

**Code Description**: The `rotate` method within the `Braid` class creates and returns a new Braid object with its structure mirrored. Specifically, it initializes a new Braid instance using the current object's codomain reversed (`*self.cod.r`). If the original Braid is not marked as daggered (i.e., `self.is_dagger` is False), then this new Braid will have its is_dagger attribute set to True and return the dagger of the newly created Braid. Otherwise, if the original Braid is already daggered, it returns the newly created Braid without further modification.

The method effectively swaps the roles of the left and right sides in a manner similar to how `dagger` operates but with an additional twist based on the value of the `left` parameter (which currently is not utilized).

**Note**: Although the `left` parameter is included, it does not seem to be used within the method. This may indicate that this parameter was intended for future use or might have been part of a previous implementation.

**Output Example**: If you have a Braid object `b1` defined as follows:
```python
from discopy.braided import Braid

# Assume some initialization of b1
```
Calling the `rotate` method on `b1` would produce a new Braid instance with its codomain reversed and the is_dagger attribute set to True if it was False in the original object, or vice versa. For example:
```python
new_braid = b1.rotate()
```
The `new_braid` object will have its left side as what was originally on the right of `b1`, and vice versa, with the is_dagger attribute flipped compared to `b1`.
***
## ClassDef Twist
**Twist**: The function of `Twist` is to represent a balanced twist operation within a ribbon category.
**Attributes**: 
· left (pivotal.Ty): The type on the top left and bottom right.
· right (pivotal.Ty): The type on the top right and bottom left.
· is_dagger (bool): Determines whether the twist is over or under.

**Code Description**: 
The `Twist` class inherits from both `balanced.Twist` and `Box`, making it a pivotal and balanced box in a ribbon diagram. This class represents a specific type of operation within a ribbon category, where the twist operation can be performed on two types: one on the top left and bottom right (`left`), and another on the top right and bottom left (`right`). The `is_dagger` attribute indicates whether the twist is an over or under twist.

The class includes a static variable `z` which is set to 0, but its significance within the context of the class is not explicitly defined in the provided code. Additionally, the `rotate` method simply returns the current instance without any modifications, suggesting that this operation might be intended for future implementations or specific use cases.

The `Twist` class interacts with other parts of the project through methods such as:
- **`rotate(left=False)`**: This method is called by other objects in the project. It currently does not utilize the `left` parameter and simply returns the current instance, indicating that this may be a placeholder or an interface for future functionality.

**Note**: 
1. The `z` attribute might have a specific purpose within the broader context of the project, which is not evident from the provided code snippet.
2. The `rotate` method's implementation does not change any state and only returns the current instance, suggesting that it may be used for certain types of pattern matching or as a placeholder for future operations.

**Output Example**: 
```python
x = Ty('x')
twist = Twist(x)
print(twist)  # Output: <Twist object at 0x7f8b2c3d4590>
```
This example demonstrates the creation of a `Twist` instance and its basic representation.
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return the current Twist object without any modification.
**parameters**: This Function takes one optional parameter:
· parameter1: left (bool) - A flag indicating whether to perform an action related to the left side, but it currently has no effect on the functionality.

**Code Description**: 
The `rotate` method within the `Twist` class is defined with a single optional boolean parameter `left`. However, this parameter is explicitly deleted within the function body using `del left`, indicating that its presence or value does not influence the outcome of the function. The function simply returns the current instance of the Twist object.

The implementation uses `return self` to return the current object instance, which allows for method chaining if other methods are defined in the same class and follow a similar pattern. This design choice is common in Python and can be particularly useful when creating fluent interfaces or pipelines where multiple operations need to be applied sequentially.

**Note**: The deletion of the `left` parameter within the function body suggests that this parameter might have been intended for some future functionality or was part of an earlier development stage but is no longer required. Developers should not rely on this parameter having any effect, as it currently does not influence the behavior of the `rotate` method.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming twist_obj is an instance of Twist
result = twist_obj.rotate(left=True)  # The value of left does not affect the output
print(result)  # Output: <Twist object at 0x7f8b3c4d5e10>
```

## ClassDef Sum
**Sum**: The function of Sum is to represent a formal sum of ribbon diagrams.
**Attributes**:
· terms: The terms of the formal sum, represented as a tuple of Diagram objects.
· dom: The domain of the formal sum, represented by a Ty object.
· cod: The codomain of the formal sum, also represented by a Ty object.

**Code Description**: The `Sum` class is defined to encapsulate the concept of a formal sum in ribbon diagrams. It inherits from both `rigid.Sum` and `Box`, indicating its role as a pivotal and balanced box that can be used within ribbon diagrams. This inheritance suggests that the `Sum` class leverages functionality provided by these base classes, such as methods for managing input and output types.

The `Sum` class is designed to handle operations involving formal sums in the context of ribbon diagrams. A formal sum is a mathematical concept where multiple terms are combined with coefficients (in this case, implicitly 1). The `terms` attribute stores the individual diagram components that make up the sum. The `dom` and `cod` attributes define the domain and codomain of the entire sum, ensuring type consistency within the ribbon diagram framework.

The inheritance from `rigid.Sum` suggests that `Sum` may inherit methods related to sum operations or properties specific to formal sums in ribbon diagrams. Similarly, inheriting from `Box` implies that it also benefits from methods and attributes associated with boxes in ribbon diagrams, such as managing input/output types and applying certain diagrammatic transformations.

**Note**: When using the `Sum` class, ensure that all terms are valid ribbon diagrams (i.e., instances of classes derived from `Diagram`). Additionally, the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) attributes must be compatible with the overall structure of the ribbon diagram to maintain type consistency.
