## ClassDef Diagram
**Diagram**: The function of Diagram is to represent a diagram that combines the properties of both symmetric and ribbon diagrams.
**Attributes**: 
· inside (Layer): Represents the layers of the diagram.
· dom (pivotal.Ty): Represents the domain or input type of the diagram.
· cod (pivotal.Ty): Represents the codomain or output type of the diagram.

**Code Description**: The `Diagram` class is a subclass that inherits from both `symmetric.Diagram` and `ribbon.Diagram`, thereby combining their functionalities. This class serves as a foundational component for constructing diagrams within the `discopy` framework, ensuring they adhere to specific structural and operational rules defined by symmetric and ribbon categories.

The `ty_factory` attribute points to `Ty`, which is likely a factory or utility function used to create types relevant to the diagram's structure. The `trace_factory` attribute is inherited from `ribbon.Diagram`, indicating that trace operations, common in ribbon diagrams, are also applicable here. This makes `Diagram` versatile for representing complex categorical structures where both symmetry and ribbon properties are necessary.

In terms of its role within the project, `Diagram` acts as a building block for more specific diagram types such as `Box`. The `Box` class, which is defined in the same file, inherits from `Diagram` along with other related classes. This inheritance relationship ensures that any `Box` object also benefits from the combined properties of symmetric and ribbon diagrams, making it easier to work with complex categorical constructs.

**Note**: When using the `Diagram` class, ensure that you provide appropriate values for `inside`, `dom`, and `cod`. These parameters are crucial as they define the structure and behavior of the diagram. Additionally, understanding the implications of inheriting from both symmetric and ribbon categories is essential to effectively utilize this class in your categorical diagrams.
## ClassDef Box
**Box**: The function of Box is to represent a symmetric and ribbon box within a compact diagram.
· name (str): The name of the box.
· dom (pivotal.Ty): The domain or input type of the box.
· cod (pivotal.Ty): The codomain or output type of the box.

**Code Description**: The `Box` class is defined to inherit from three different classes: `symmetric.Box`, `ribbon.Box`, and `Diagram`. This inheritance structure ensures that a `Box` object combines the properties of both symmetric and ribbon categories, making it versatile for representing complex categorical structures within the `discopy` framework.

The `Box` class inherits several attributes and methods from its parent classes:
- From `symmetric.Box`: The class likely gains specific functionalities related to symmetry operations.
- From `ribbon.Box`: It may gain trace operations or other ribbon-specific features.
- From `Diagram`: It benefits from the foundational structure of a diagram, including handling layers (`inside`), domain (`dom`), and codomain (`cod`).

The `Box` class serves as an essential building block for constructing more complex diagrams. For instance:
- The `Cup` and `Cap` classes, which inherit directly from `Box`, represent specific types of boxes commonly used in categorical diagram constructions.
- Similarly, the `Swap` class also inherits from `Box`, indicating its role in representing swaps within a compact diagram.

By inheriting from these multiple classes, the `Box` class ensures that it can be used in various contexts where both symmetry and ribbon properties are required. This makes it a flexible tool for creating and manipulating categorical diagrams.

**Note**: When using the `Box` class, ensure you provide meaningful values for the `name`, `dom`, and `cod` parameters to define the structure and behavior of the box within your diagram. Understanding the implications of inheriting from both symmetric and ribbon categories is crucial for effective use in complex categorical constructions.
## ClassDef Cup
**Cup**: The function of Cup is to represent a ribbon cup within a compact diagram.
· left (pivotal.Ty): The atomic type on one side of the cup.
· right (pivotal.Ty): The adjoint of the atomic type on the other side of the cup.

**Code Description**: The `Cup` class in the `discopy/compact.py` module is designed to model a ribbon cup within the context of compact diagrams. It inherits from both `ribbon.Cup` and `Box`, ensuring that it retains properties from both categories while being specifically tailored for use in compact diagrams.

Inheriting from `ribbon.Cup` ensures that the `Cup` class can handle operations specific to ribbon categories, such as trace operations or other ribbon-specific features. The inheritance from `Box` allows the `Cup` class to be part of a broader framework where it can interact with other boxes and diagrams in a consistent manner.

The `Cup` class is used in constructing more complex categorical diagrams within the `discopy` framework, often alongside other classes like `Cap`, which are also inherited from `Box`. The `test_Cup_Cap_dagger` function demonstrates how `Cup` and its operations can be tested, ensuring that the cup's dagger operation correctly maps to a `Cap`.

In the `test_cup_chaining` function, the `Cup` class is used in chaining multiple cups within a diagram. This test case helps verify that the `cup` method works as expected when applied to different parts of a diagram, including handling swaps and ensuring the correct structure of the resulting diagram.

Understanding the role of `Cup` within the broader context of compact diagrams is crucial for effectively using it in various categorical constructions. It serves as an essential building block for creating complex diagrams that need both symmetry and ribbon properties.

**Note**: When working with `Cup`, ensure you provide appropriate atomic types for the `left` and `right` parameters to define its structure within your diagram accurately. The inheritance from multiple classes ensures flexibility but also requires careful consideration of how these inherited features interact in practical scenarios.

· **attributes**:
    - `left (pivotal.Ty)`: The atomic type on one side of the Cap.
    - `right (pivotal.Ty)`: Its adjoint, representing the other side.

**Code Description**: The `Cap` class is designed to be a component in compact diagrams. It inherits from both `ribbon.Cap` and `Box`, ensuring it combines properties from these categories. By inheriting from `Box`, `Cap` gains access to functionalities such as handling layers (`inside`), domain (`dom`), and codomain (`cod`). The dual nature of `Cap` through its inheritance allows for versatile use in both symmetric and ribbon contexts.

The `Cap` class is part of the broader `discopy` framework, which aims to facilitate the construction and manipulation of categorical diagrams. Specifically, it plays a crucial role alongside other classes like `Box`, `Cup`, and `Swap`. The `Cap` class is used to represent specific types of boxes within compact diagrams, often appearing in scenarios where ribbon properties are essential.

In the context of the project, `Cap` is called by several test functions. For instance, it appears in the `test_draw_who` function, where it is used as part of a diagram construction that involves other components like `Box`. Additionally, `Cap` is referenced in the `test_Cup_Cap_dagger` function, which tests its behavior with respect to the dagger operation, comparing `Cap(n, n.l).dagger()` to `Cup(n, n.l)`.

**Note**: When using the `Cap` class, ensure you provide meaningful values for the `left` and `right` parameters. These parameters define the atomic type on each side of the Cap, which is crucial for its correct placement within a compact diagram.

## ClassDef Category
**Category**: The function of Category is to represent both symmetric and ribbon categories.
**Attributes**:
· ob: Represents the objects of the category, defaulting to :class:`pivotal.Ty`.
· ar: Represents the arrows or morphisms in the category, defaulting to :class:`Diagram`.

**Code Description**: 
The `Category` class is a fundamental component within the `discopy` framework, designed to encapsulate the properties of both symmetric and ribbon categories. By inheriting from both `symmetric.Category` and `ribbon.Category`, it ensures that any instance of this category adheres to the structural and operational rules defined by these more specialized categories.

The default values for `ob` and `ar` are set to `Ty` and `Diagram`, respectively, which are essential in defining the structure and behavior of diagrams within the category. Specifically:
- `Ty` is likely a utility function or class used to create types relevant to the diagram's structure.
- `Diagram` combines properties from both symmetric and ribbon categories, serving as a foundational component for constructing complex categorical diagrams.

This class plays a crucial role in ensuring that all operations and constructs within the category respect the axioms of symmetric and ribbon categories. The combination of these properties makes `Category` versatile for representing a wide range of categorical structures, including those found in quantum computing and other areas where symmetry and trace operations are important.

**Note**: When using the `Category` class, ensure that you provide appropriate values for `ob` and `ar`. These parameters are crucial as they define the structure and behavior of the category. Additionally, understanding the implications of inheriting from both symmetric and ribbon categories is essential to effectively utilize this class in your categorical diagrams.

In the context of its callers and callees within the project:
- The `Category` class is used by the `Functor` class, which inherits from it and combines properties from both symmetric and ribbon functors. This ensures that any functor defined using a `Category` as its domain or codomain will respect the combined axioms.
- The `Hypergraph` class references `Category`, indicating that hypergraphs within this framework are structured according to these categorical principles.

By leveraging the combined properties of symmetric and ribbon categories, the `Category` class provides a robust foundation for constructing complex diagrams and functors in the `discopy` project.
## ClassDef Functor
**Functor**: The function of Functor is to represent functors that operate on both symmetric and ribbon categories.

**Attributes**:
· ob (Mapping[pivotal.Ty, pivotal.Ty]): Maps from atomic :class:`pivotal.Ty` to :code:`cod.ob`.
· ar (Mapping[Box, Diagram]): Maps from :class:`Box` to :code:`cod.ar`.

**Code Description**: The `Functor` class is a composite functor that inherits properties from both symmetric and ribbon functors. It combines the functionalities of these two types of functors by defining mappings for objects (`ob`) and arrows (`ar`). Specifically, it maps atomic types in the domain category to the codomain category's objects and boxes (representing morphisms) to diagrams within the codomain.

The `Functor` class includes a constructor that takes three parameters: `ob`, `ar`, and `cod`. The `ob` parameter is a mapping from atomic types (`pivotal.Ty`) in the domain to the corresponding objects in the codomain. The `ar` parameter maps boxes (morphisms) in the domain to diagrams in the codomain, while `cod` specifies the codomain category.

The `__call__` method of the `Functor` class is overridden to handle specific operations based on the type of input. If the input is an instance of `Swap`, it delegates the call to the symmetric functor's implementation via `symmetric.Functor.__call__(self, other)`. Otherwise, it falls back to the ribbon functor's implementation via `ribbon.Functor.__call__(self, other)`.

This design ensures that the `Functor` class can seamlessly integrate and apply operations defined by both symmetric and ribbon categories. The `Category` class serves as a foundational category for these functors, providing the necessary structure and behavior to ensure consistency across different types of categorical diagrams and transformations.

**Note**: Ensure that you provide appropriate mappings for `ob` and `ar` when creating instances of the `Functor` class. These parameters are crucial in defining how objects and morphisms are transformed between categories.

**Output Example**: An example usage might involve transforming a diagram within a domain category to its corresponding representation in a codomain category, handling specific operations like swaps or copying/merging boxes according to their types.

· functor: Represents the functor associated with this hypergraph, defaulting to `Functor`.

**Code Description**: The `Hypergraph` class is designed to encapsulate structures that can be represented within a symmetric and ribbon category framework. It inherits from the `symmetric.Hypergraph` class and sets its `category` attribute to `Category` and `functor` attribute to `Functor`. This setup ensures that hypergraphs are constructed according to the rules defined by both symmetric and ribbon categories.

The default values for `category` and `functor` indicate that any instance of `Hypergraph` will operate within a category that combines properties from symmetric and ribbon categories. The `Category` class provides the foundational structure, while the `Functor` ensures consistent transformation operations across different types of morphisms.

In terms of its relationship with other classes in the project:
- **Relationship with Category**: By setting `category` to `Category`, a hypergraph inherits properties that ensure it respects both symmetric and ribbon category axioms. This integration allows for more complex categorical structures, making it suitable for applications where these categories are relevant.
- **Relationship with Functor**: The association with `Functor` through the `functor` attribute means that operations on hypergraphs can be mapped to diagrams within the category. This ensures that transformations and mappings defined by functors are applied consistently across different parts of the hypergraph.

**Note**: When using the `Hypergraph` class, ensure that you understand the implications of operating within a symmetric and ribbon category framework. The default settings provide a robust foundation but may need customization depending on specific use cases.
