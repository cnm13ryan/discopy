- **content**: A string containing the main text content of the document.

#### Methods

- **addText(text: string, position?: number): void**
  - Adds a block of text to the current document at the specified position. If no position is provided, the text is appended to the end of the document.
  
- **insertImage(imagePath: string, position?: number): void**
  - Inserts an image into the document from the given file path at the specified position. If no position is provided, the image is inserted at the end.

- **addTable(rows: number, columns: number, position?: number): void**
  - Adds a table with the specified number of rows and columns to the document. The table can be positioned either at the current cursor or at the end if no specific position is given.
  
- **save(filename: string): void**
  - Saves the current state of the document to a file with the provided filename.

- **load(filename: string): void**
  - Loads an existing document from a file with the specified filename, overwriting any current content.

- **deleteContent(startIndex: number, endIndex: number): void**
  - Deletes the content between two indices within the document. The `startIndex` and `endIndex` parameters define the range of text to be deleted.
  
- **formatText(text: string, style: {bold?: boolean; italic?: boolean; underline?: boolean}): void**
  - Applies a specified formatting style to a block of text.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
// Create a new document and set its title and author

```

This documentation provides a clear and concise overview of the `Document` object's properties and methods, along with example usage.
### FunctionDef __pow__(self, other)
**__pow__**: The function of __pow__ is to perform exponentiation between two type objects.
· parameter1: other (Ty)
   - Description: The exponent type with which the base type will be raised.

**Code Description**: 
The `__pow__` method in the `Ty` class is designed to handle exponentiation operations. When called, it checks whether the `other` argument is an instance of the `Ty` class. If so, it returns a new `Exp` object representing the base type raised to the power of the exponent type. This operation essentially constructs a new type that represents the combination of two types in the context of category theory.

The method uses the following logic:
- **Check Type**: It first checks if `other` is an instance of `Ty`. If it is, then it proceeds to create an `Exp` object.
- **Create Exponentiation Type**: The `Exp` object is created with the current type as the base and `other` as the exponent. This operation effectively models a type transformation or category theory construction where one type is raised to another.

If `other` is not a `Ty` instance, it simply returns `False`, indicating that the operation cannot be performed in this context.

This method interacts with the `Exp` class, which handles the actual representation and manipulation of these exponentiation types. The `Exp` class provides properties like `left` and `right` to access the base and exponent parts respectively, ensuring that the structure of the new type is correctly represented.

**Note**: Ensure that both the base and exponent are valid instances of `Ty` for meaningful results. If they are not, the method will return `False`, indicating an invalid operation.

**Output Example**: 
If you have a `Ty` object representing a type called `A` and another `Ty` object representing a type called `B`, calling `A ** B` would result in an `Exp` object where `base = A` and `exponent = B`. The resulting `Exp` object can then be used for further operations or transformations within the category theory framework.
***
### FunctionDef __lshift__(self, other)
**__lshift__**: The function of __lshift__ is to create an Over type by combining a base type and an exponent type.
**Parameters**:
· other: An instance of the Ty class representing the exponent type.

**Code Description**: This method takes another Ty object as input and returns an Over object, which represents a combination of the current Ty object (base) and the provided Ty object (exponent). The `__lshift__` operator is overloaded to allow this operation in a more readable manner.
The `Over` class, defined elsewhere in the project, is used to construct this combined type. Specifically, it takes two parameters: the base type (`self`) and the exponent type (`other`). This method effectively allows for the creation of complex type structures using the `<<` operator.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `other` is an instance of Ty, as passing a non-Ty object will result in a TypeError. Also, note that this operation creates a new Over object rather than modifying any existing objects.

**Output Example**: If you have a base type `A` and an exponent type `B`, calling `A << B` would return an Over instance with the base as `A` and the exponent as `B`. For example:
```python
base = Ty("A")
exponent = Ty("B")
combined_type = base << exponent  # combined_type is an instance of Over(A, B)
print(combined_type)  # Output: (A << B)
```
***
### FunctionDef __rshift__(self, other)
**__rshift__**: The function of __rshift__ is to return an instance of Under with self as the exponent and other as the base.
**Parameters**: 
· self: An instance of Ty.
· other: The type to be used as the base in the Under construction.

**Code Description**: The `__rshift__` method in the `Ty` class is a special method that allows for operator overloading. Specifically, it enables the use of the ">>" operator to create an instance of the `Under` class with self as the exponent and other as the base. This method plays a crucial role in defining how types can be combined or transformed within the context of this type system.

In functional terms, when you call `self >> other`, it constructs an object that represents the "under" relationship between two types, where `other` is under `self`. The `Under` class, which is a subclass of `Exp`, encapsulates this relationship and provides additional functionality related to these types. This method is essential for creating complex type structures in a functional programming context.

**Note**: Ensure that the input parameters are valid instances of the appropriate classes (i.e., self should be an instance of Ty, and other should be compatible with the base requirement of Under). Misuse can lead to incorrect type representations or potential errors downstream when these types are used in further operations.

**Output Example**: If `self` is an instance representing a function type from integers to strings (`Ty(Int, Str)`) and `other` is an integer type (`Int`), then calling `self >> other` would return an instance of `Under` where the exponent is `Str` and the base is `Int`, effectively creating a structure like `Under(Str, Int)`.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Ty object.
**Parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the Ty class.

**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method returns a string that represents the current state of the `Ty` object. This string includes the name of the factory function and a list of all elements inside the `Ty` object, each represented by their own `__repr__` values.

1. **factory_name(type(self))**: The `factory_name` is called with the class type of `self`. It returns a string that describes the `Ty` class in the context of its module and name.
2. **map(repr, self.inside)**: This maps the `repr` function over all elements inside the `Ty` object, converting each element to its string representation.
3. **join(map(repr, self.inside))**: The results from the previous step are joined into a single string with commas and spaces.
4. **f"({', '.join(map(repr, self.inside))})"**: This formats the inside elements as part of the Ty object's string representation.

The `__repr__` method ensures that when an instance of `Ty` is printed or displayed in the console, it provides a clear and informative view of its internal structure.

**Note**: The use of `factory_name` helps maintain consistency across different parts of the system by ensuring that class names are correctly formatted. This function also aids in debugging and understanding the structure of complex objects.

**Output Example**: If `Ty` has two elements, say "A" and "B", the output might look like:
```
"Ty(A, B)"
```
***
### FunctionDef left(self)
**left**: The function of left is to return the left part of the type if it is an Exp object.
**Parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `left` method is defined within the `Ty` class, which represents types in the context of a categorical quantum mechanics library. It checks whether the current instance (`self`) is an `Exp` (exponential) type by verifying if it contains exactly one element and that this element is an instance of the `Exp` class. If so, it returns the left part of this `Exp` object using the `left` method. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

The method makes use of the `is_exp` attribute to determine whether the current type should be treated as an exponential type. This check is crucial for ensuring that only valid exponential types are processed by the `left` method.

This function interacts with the `Exp` class and its `left` method, which must be defined elsewhere in the codebase. The `is_exp` attribute checks if the current type is a single-element tuple containing an instance of `Exp`, thereby ensuring that only valid exponential types are processed by the `left` method.

**Note**: Ensure that the `Exp` class and its `left` method are properly defined to avoid runtime errors.
**Output Example**: If the current instance represents an exponential type `(x @ y)`, calling `left()` will return the left part of this type, which is `x`. If it does not represent an exponential type or if there are multiple elements in the tuple, `None` will be returned.
***
### FunctionDef right(self)
**right**: The function of `right` is to return the right side of an operation if it is an `Exp` type; otherwise, it returns `None`.
**parameters**: 
· self: The current instance of the `Ty` class.
**Code Description**: The `right` method checks whether the left side of a type operation (`self.inside[0]`) is an `Exp` object. If so, it returns the right side of this operation as another `Ty` object; otherwise, it returns `None`. This functionality is crucial for parsing and manipulating types in a categorical or functional context.
**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.is_exp` evaluates to `True` before calling `right`, as it relies on this condition. If `is_exp` is `False`, the method will return `None`.
- The method assumes that each type operation has a well-defined left and right side, which are stored in `self.inside[0]` and `self.inside[1]` respectively.
**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming x and y are instances of Ty representing types
x = Ty('x')
y = Ty('y')

# If (x ** y) is an Exp object, right will return the type on its right side
assert (x ** y).right == y

# If (x ** y @ Ty()) is not an Exp object, right returns None
assert (x ** y @ Ty()).right is None
```

###
***
### FunctionDef is_under(self)
**is_under**: The function of `is_under` is to determine if the type is an instance of the `Under` class.
**Parameters**: 
· None

**Code Description**: This method checks whether the current type (`self`) is an instance of the `Under` class and verifies that it contains exactly one element. If these conditions are met, the method returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The `is_under` method is useful for identifying specific types within a hierarchy where certain operations or behaviors depend on whether a type is under another.

The method makes use of the following attributes and methods:
- `len(self)`: This checks if the length of the current object is exactly 1.
- `self.inside[0]`: This accesses the first element inside the current type, which should be an instance of the `Under` class for the method to return `True`.

The functional perspective on this method involves its relationship with other classes and methods in the project. Specifically, it interacts with types that are part of a broader type hierarchy, such as the `Ty` class. This helps in distinguishing between different types within the system, ensuring that operations specific to `Under` types can be applied appropriately.

**Note**: Ensure that the method is called on instances where the length and structure of the type align with the expected conditions for an `Under` object. Calling this method on inappropriate types may result in incorrect behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: If `x = Ty('x') >> Ty('y')`, then `x.is_under()` would return `True`. Conversely, if `z = Ty('z')`, then `z.is_under()` would return `False`.
***
### FunctionDef is_over(self)
**is_over**: The function `is_over` checks whether the type is an instance of `Over`.
**parameters**: 
· self: The current instance of the `Ty` class.

**Code Description**: The `is_over` method determines if the given type (represented by a `Ty` object) is specifically an `Over` type. It does this by checking two conditions:
1. Whether the length of the type, which corresponds to the number of components in it, equals 1.
2. If the first and only component inside the type is an instance of the `Over` class.

The method returns a boolean value indicating whether these conditions are met. This functionality is crucial for distinguishing between different types that might be used within the `discopy` library, ensuring that operations specific to `Over` types can be correctly identified and applied.

**Note**: Ensure that the type being checked has only one component before calling this method. If the length of the type is not 1, the method will return False regardless of what the single component might be.

**Output Example**: 
```python
x = Ty('x')
y = Ty('y')

# Both (x << y) and (x << y @ Ty()) are Over types since they have exactly one component.
assert (x << y).is_over  # True
assert (x << y @ Ty()).is_over  # True

# A type with more than one component is not an Over type.
z = x << y << z
assert not z.is_over  # False
```

### FunctionDef __init__(self, base, exponent)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Exp class by setting its base and exponent attributes.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: base (Ty) - The base type of the exponential expression.
· parameter2: exponent (Ty) - The exponent type of the exponential expression.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Exp` class by setting its attributes to the provided `base` and `exponent` parameters. It then calls the superclass's `__init__` method using `super().__init__(self)`, which is a common practice in inheritance to ensure that the parent class's initialization code is executed.

The `Exp` class represents an exponential type, where one type (the base) is raised to the power of another type (the exponent). This is crucial for understanding and manipulating types within the context of functional programming and category theory as applied in this project. The method ensures that each instance of `Exp` correctly holds its base and exponent values.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that both `base` and `exponent` are instances of `Ty`, as specified by their type hints.
- Properly handling these attributes is essential for the correct functioning of operations involving exponential types, such as composition or evaluation within the broader context of the project.
***
### FunctionDef left(self)
**left**: The function of `left` is to return either the exponent if the current instance is an `Under` type or the base otherwise.
**Parameters**: There are no explicit parameters defined for this method within its definition.
**Code Description**: This method serves as a conditional accessor, returning different parts of the object based on its type. Specifically:
- If the current instance is an `Under` type, it returns the exponent (`self.exponent`).
- Otherwise, it returns the base (`self.base`).

This functionality is crucial for handling and distinguishing between two types of operations within the `Exp` class hierarchy, ensuring that appropriate parts are accessed based on the object's nature.

**Note**: When using this method, ensure that you understand the type of the current instance. Calling `left()` on an instance that is not an `Under` might return unexpected results.
**Output Example**: If the current instance is an `Under` with exponent "A" and base "B", then calling `self.left()` would return "A". If it's a different type, such as a simple `Exp` with just a base "C", then `self.left()` would return "C".
***
### FunctionDef right(self)
**right**: The function of right is to return either the base or exponent based on the type of the current instance.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `right` method checks whether the current instance of `Exp` is an instance of `Under`. If it is, the method returns the `base` attribute; otherwise, it returns the `exponent` attribute. This functionality is crucial for distinguishing between different types of `Exp` instances and handling them appropriately in various parts of the code.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `self` parameter refers to an instance of either `Under` or another subclass of `Exp`. The method will behave unpredictably if called on a type other than these.
- This method is particularly useful when implementing methods that need to handle both base and exponent types differently based on their context.

**Output Example**: 
If the current instance is an `Under` object, and its `base` attribute contains "user" and `exponent` attribute contains "role", then:
```
right() -> "user"
```
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to compare two Exp objects for equality.
**parameters**: 
· self: The current instance of the Exp class.
· other: The object to be compared with.

**Code Description**: The `__eq__` method in the `Exp` class checks if the current instance (`self`) is equal to another object (`other`). It performs this check based on the following logic:
1. **Type Check**: First, it verifies whether `other` is an instance of the same type as `self`. This ensures that only instances of `Exp` can be compared.
2. **Equality Check**: If `other` is indeed an instance of `Exp`, it compares the tuple `(self.base, self.exponent)` with `(other.base, other.exponent)`.
3. **Special Case Handling**: If `other` is an instance of `Exp`, but not equal to `self`, it returns `False`. This step avoids potential infinite loops that could arise from comparing instances of `Exp` recursively.
4. **Default Case**: Finally, if `other` is neither an instance of the same type as `self` nor an instance of `Exp`, it checks whether `other` is an instance of `Ty` and returns a boolean value based on whether `other.inside` matches `(self, )`.

This method ensures that only objects with identical base and exponent properties can be considered equal, providing a clear and consistent way to compare instances of the `Exp` class.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all comparisons are made between valid types to avoid unexpected behavior.
- The method handles special cases where `other` might be an instance of `Ty`, ensuring that only appropriate objects can be compared.

**Output Example**: If two `Exp` objects have the same base and exponent, the method returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. For example:
```python
exp1 = Exp('x', 'y')
exp2 = Exp('x', 'y')
exp3 = Exp('z', 'y')

# Output: True
print(exp1 == exp2)

# Output: False
print(exp1 == exp3)
```

This method is crucial for ensuring that equality checks between `Exp` objects are handled correctly and consistently.
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to return a unique identifier for an instance based on its string representation.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method returns the hash value of the object, which is used in hash tables like sets and dictionaries. In this implementation, it uses the `repr(self)` to generate a string representation of the current instance and then hashes that string using Python's built-in `hash()` function. The use of `repr(self)` ensures that the hash is based on the object’s state, providing a consistent identifier for each unique object.

The choice of using `repr` as opposed to `str` is significant because `repr` provides a more complete representation of the object, which includes its class and attributes. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex objects or debugging, ensuring that the hash value reflects all relevant aspects of the instance.
**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `__hash__` method is consistent with the equality check (`__eq__`). If two instances are considered equal by `__eq__`, they should return the same hash value.
- The hash values may change between Python versions or different interpreter runs, so it's important to rely on the object’s state for consistency rather than external factors.
**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `Exp` has a string representation `"Exp('x', 'y')"` (assuming `self` contains `'x'` and `'y'`), then the output of `__hash__` would be something like `-123456789`, which is the hash value of the string `"Exp('x', 'y')"`.
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the current Exp instance.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `__str__` method provides a human-readable string format for instances of the `Exp` class. Specifically, it returns a string that represents the mathematical expression in the form of `(base ** exponent)`, where `base` and `exponent` are attributes of the current instance.

- The method uses an f-string to construct the output string.
- It concatenates the value of `self.base` with the string `"**"`, followed by `self.exponent`.
- This is useful for debugging or logging purposes, as it allows developers to easily understand the state of an `Exp` object at any given point.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `base` and `exponent` are correctly defined in the `Exp` class.
- The method assumes that both `base` and `exponent` are valid for use in a string representation, which should be validated elsewhere if necessary.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `Exp` has `self.base = 2` and `self.exponent = 3`, the `__str__` method will return the string `"2 ** 3"`.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of `__repr__` is to return a string representation of the Exp object that can be used to recreate the object.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the Exp class on which the method is called.

**Code Description**: The `__repr__` method in the `Exp` class returns a string that represents the current state of an `Exp` object. This string includes the factory name of the class and the representations of both the base and exponent objects within the `Exp` instance. Specifically, it uses the `factory_name` function to get the full path to the class and then formats this with the base and exponent values.

The method constructs a string in the format:
```
<factory_name>(repr(base), repr(exponent))
```
Where:
- `<factory_name>` is obtained by calling `factory_name(type(self))`, which provides the fully qualified name of the `Exp` class.
- `repr(self.base)` and `repr(self.exponent)` provide string representations of the base and exponent objects, respectively.

This ensures that when the returned string is evaluated, it will recreate an instance of the `Exp` class with the same base and exponent values as the current object. The use of `repr` for both the base and exponent guarantees that these values are represented in a way that can be used to reconstruct the exact state of the object.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `factory_name` function is correctly defined and available in the scope where this method is called.
- This implementation assumes that the `base` and `exponent` attributes of the `Exp` class are objects that also have a `__repr__` method implemented to provide meaningful string representations.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `Exp` has a base of "x" and an exponent of "2", the output might look like:
```
grammar.exp.Exp('x', '2')
```
***
### FunctionDef to_tree(self)
**to_tree**: The function of `to_tree` is to convert an instance of the `Exp` class into a tree-like structure representation.
**Parameters**:
· self: An instance of the `Exp` class.

**Code Description**: 
The `to_tree` method converts the current instance of the `Exp` class into a dictionary that represents its structure. This dictionary includes three key components:
- **'factory'**: A string representing the factory name for the class type, which is obtained by calling the `factory_name` function with the class type as an argument.
- **'base'**: The result of recursively converting the `base` attribute into a tree-like structure using the same `to_tree` method.
- **'exponent'**: The result of recursively converting the `exponent` attribute into a tree-like structure using the same `to_tree` method.

This method is particularly useful for serializing or visualizing the internal structure of an `Exp` object in a structured format, such as JSON. It helps in understanding and manipulating complex expressions represented by instances of the `Exp` class.

**Note**: The `factory_name` function is called to generate the factory name string, which provides context about the type of expression being represented. This ensures that the structure accurately reflects the type of operation or term involved.

**Output Example**: 
For an instance of `Exp` with a base and exponent both being instances of another class (e.g., `Word`), the output might look like this:
```python
{
    'factory': 'grammar.pregroup.Word',
    'base': {
        'factory': 'grammar.pregroup.Word',
        'content': 'apple'
    },
    'exponent': {
        'factory': 'grammar.pregroup.Word',
        'content': 'red'
    }
}
```
This example shows how the `to_tree` method breaks down an expression into its constituent parts, providing a clear and structured representation.
***
### FunctionDef from_tree(cls, tree)
**from_tree**: The function of `from_tree` is to construct an instance of the class based on a tree structure.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `tree`, which is expected to be a dictionary representing a tree with keys 'base' and 'exponent'.

**Code Description**: 
The `from_tree` method takes a single argument, `tree`, which should be a dictionary containing two key-value pairs: `'base'` and `'exponent'`. The function recursively constructs instances of the class (in this case, `Exp`) by calling itself on each of these values. It then returns an instance of the current class (`cls`) initialized with the results of applying `from_tree` to both the 'base' and 'exponent' keys.

Here is a detailed analysis:
1. The method starts by unpacking the dictionary `tree`, expecting it to contain two entries: `'base'` and `'exponent'`.
2. It uses the built-in `map` function to apply `from_tree` to each of these values, effectively constructing instances based on their sub-structures.
3. The `*map(from_tree, (tree['base'], tree['exponent']))` expression passes a tuple containing the results of applying `from_tree` to both `'base'` and `'exponent'` as arguments to the class constructor (`cls`) in an unpacked form.
4. This process continues recursively until all elements are fully constructed.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input dictionary always contains the keys 'base' and 'exponent'. If these keys are missing or if the values do not conform to the expected structure, this method will raise a `KeyError` or fail due to incorrect data.
- The function assumes that the class has a constructor that accepts multiple arguments. This is why it uses `*map`, which unpacks the results of `map`.

**Output Example**: 
If `tree = {'base': {'base': 1, 'exponent': 2}, 'exponent': {'base': 3, 'exponent': 4}}` and assuming that `Exp` is defined such that it can handle these inputs, the output might be an instance of `Exp` constructed from the nested structure. For example:
```python
exp_instance = Exp(Exp(1, 2), Exp(3, 4))
```
This represents a recursive construction where each node in the tree corresponds to an instance of `Exp`.
***
### FunctionDef to_drawing(self)
**to_drawing**: The function of `to_drawing` is to convert the current type representation into a drawing format.
**Parameters**:
· self: An instance of the `Exp` class.

**Code Description**: 
The `to_drawing` method converts the internal representation of an `Exp` object into a visual or graphical form, which could be used for rendering diagrams or visual representations in a diagrammatic language. This is achieved by first converting the type to its string representation using `Ty(str(self))`, and then calling the `to_drawing()` method on this string. The internal structure of `Ty` handles the conversion logic from a textual description into a graphical format, ensuring that the resulting drawing accurately represents the type's structure.

This function is particularly useful in visualizing complex type relationships or compositions within a diagrammatic framework. By leveraging the `Ty` class to handle the text-to-drawing conversion, it ensures consistency and correctness in rendering these types visually.

**Note**: Ensure that the input object (`self`) is properly formatted as an `Exp` instance before calling this method. The resulting drawing should accurately reflect the type's structure for clarity and understanding.

**Output Example**: 
Given an `Exp` instance representing a type composition, such as `(x ** y) @ z`, the output would be a visual representation of this composition, possibly showing the exponential relationship between types and their combination with other types. The exact appearance will depend on how the `Ty.to_drawing()` method is implemented, but it might include boxes for each type and arrows or lines to indicate the relationships between them.

### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the Over object.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__str__` method returns a string that represents the current state of an `Over` object. Specifically, it constructs and returns a string in the format `"(base << exponent)"`, where `base` is the value stored in the `self.base` attribute and `exponent` is the value stored in the `self.exponent` attribute.

Here's a detailed analysis:
- The method uses an f-string to construct the representation. An f-string allows for embedding expressions inside string literals, making it easy to format strings.
- Inside the f-string, `f"({self.base} << {self.exponent})"` is used, which ensures that the base and exponent attributes are properly formatted within parentheses and separated by a double angle bracket (`<<`).
- The use of this method allows for a clear and concise string representation of an `Over` object, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.base` and `self.exponent` are correctly defined in the class definition to avoid runtime errors. Additionally, consider the data types of these attributes; they should be compatible with string formatting (e.g., both should be strings or representable as strings).

**Output Example**: If an instance of the `Over` class has `base = "x"` and `exponent = "3"`, then calling `__str__` on this object would return `"('x' << '3')"`.

This method provides a clear, readable string representation that reflects the internal structure of the `Over` object.

### FunctionDef curry(self, n, left)
**curry**: The function of curry is to create a curried diagram based on the current diagram.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: n (integer) - The number of atomic types to curry. Default value is 1.
· parameter2: left (boolean) - Whether to curry on the left or right. Default value is True.

**Code Description**: This method `curry` serves as a wrapper that calls another internal method `curry_factory`. It takes in two parameters, `n` and `left`, which determine how many atomic types should be curried and whether the currying operation should occur on the left or right side of the diagram. The function returns a new `Diagram` object representing the curried version of the original diagram.

The method is called by a `Functor` to apply currying operations, which are common in functional programming for transforming functions into higher-order functions that can be partially applied. In this context, it modifies the current diagram by currying its atomic types according to the specified parameters.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the value of `n` is appropriate for the number of atomic types present in your diagram.
- The choice between left and right currying should align with the structure and intended transformation of the diagram.

**Output Example**: If you have a diagram representing a function with three input types, calling `curry(n=2, left=True)` would return a new diagram where the first two inputs are curried on the left side.
***
### FunctionDef ev(cls, base, exponent, left)
**ev**: The function of ev is to create an evaluation instance based on the given base and exponent types.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: base : Ty - The base type of the exponential type to evaluate.
· parameter2: exponent : Ty - The exponent type of the exponential type to evaluate.
· parameter3: left : bool (default True) - Whether to perform evaluation on the left or right side.

**Code Description**: 
The `ev` method is a factory function that generates an instance of `Eval`, which is presumably used for evaluating morphisms in a diagrammatic categorical context. It takes two type arguments, `base` and `exponent`, representing the base and exponent parts of an exponential type. The parameter `left` determines whether the evaluation should be performed on the left or right side, affecting how the types are combined using either the `<<` (left) or `>>` (right) operators.

This method is a key component in the implementation of categorical operations within the `Diagram` class and relies on the `eval_factory` method to instantiate an appropriate evaluation object. Depending on the value of `left`, it constructs a new type using either the `<<` (left) or `>>` (right) operator, effectively setting up the evaluation context for further diagrammatic operations.

The `ev` method is called by other methods within the `Diagram` class, such as `uncurry`. For instance, in the `uncurry` method, it is used to create an evaluation instance that helps in composing a closed diagram with another diagram or type. This demonstrates its importance in the overall structure and functionality of the categorical diagram library.

**Note**: Ensure that the types passed to `ev` are valid instances of `Ty`, as this function relies on their properties for correct operation. The `left` parameter is crucial, as it determines the directionality of the evaluation, which can significantly affect the resulting type and subsequent operations.

**Output Example**: Given a `base` type `x` and an `exponent` type `y`, calling `ev(x, y, True)` would return an instance of `Eval` configured for left evaluation, while `ev(x, y, False)` would configure it for right evaluation.
***
### FunctionDef uncurry(self, left)
**uncurry**: The function of uncurry is to transform a closed diagram by composing it with an evaluation instance created using :meth:`Diagram.ev`.

**Parameters**: 
· parameter1: left : bool (default True) - Determines whether to uncurry on the left or right.

**Code Description**: The `uncurry` method in the `Diagram` class is responsible for creating a new diagram by composing the current diagram with an evaluation instance. This composition involves either left (`left=True`) or right (`left=False`) evaluation, depending on the value of the `left` parameter. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Base and Exponent Extraction**: The method first extracts the base and exponent from the codomain of the current diagram using `self.cod.base` and `self.cod.exponent`. These represent the types involved in the exponential relationship that the diagram operates on.

2. **Left Uncurrying**:
   - If `left=True`, the method composes the current diagram with an evaluation instance created by calling `self.ev(base, exponent, True)`.
   - This evaluation instance is then appended to a composition of the base and exponent using the left operator (`<<`), effectively creating a new diagram where the original diagram is evaluated on its left side.

3. **Right Uncurrying**:
   - If `left=False`, the method composes the current diagram with an evaluation instance created by calling `self.ev(base, exponent, False)`.
   - This evaluation instance is then appended to a composition of the base and exponent using the right operator (`>>`), effectively creating a new diagram where the original diagram is evaluated on its right side.

4. **Composition Operation**: The method uses the `@` operator for function composition, which combines the current diagram with the evaluation instance created by `self.ev`. This operation ensures that the evaluation context is correctly set up based on whether `left=True` or `left=False`.

By leveraging the `ev` method to create an appropriate evaluation context, `uncurry` facilitates the transformation of a closed diagram into a new one where the original diagram's operations are evaluated. This is crucial for various categorical transformations and compositions within the library.

**Note**: Ensure that the types passed to `self.ev` are valid instances of `Ty`, as this function relies on their properties for correct operation. The `left` parameter is essential, as it dictates the directionality of the evaluation.

**Output Example**: Given a diagram representing a morphism from type `A` to type `B`, and an evaluation context defined by types `C` and `D`, calling `uncurry(True)` might result in a new diagram that represents evaluating the original morphism on its left side within the context of types `C` and `D`. Conversely, `uncurry(False)` would evaluate the same morphism on its right side.

## ClassDef Eval
**Eval**: The function of Eval is to evaluate an exponential type within a closed diagram.
**Attributes**: 
· x: The exponential type to be evaluated.

**Code Description**: 
The `Eval` class inherits from the `Box` class, which itself extends `monoidal.Box` and `Diagram`. This inheritance allows `Eval` to leverage methods and properties defined in these classes. 

In the `__init__` method of `Eval`, it takes an exponential type `x` as a parameter. The exponential type is decomposed into its base and exponent components, which are stored as attributes of the instance (`self.base` and `self.exponent`). A boolean value `left` is set to check if `x` is an `Over` type.

The method then calculates the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) based on whether `x` is a left or right `Over`. If `x` is on the left, it composes `x` with its exponent; otherwise, it composes its base with `x`. The resulting domain and codomains are used to initialize the `Box` class via the `super().__init__()` call.

This evaluation process within a closed diagram helps in managing and transforming types according to specific rules defined by the diagram. It is called by various methods such as `Functor.__call__`, which handles different operations on objects like `Over`, `Under`, `Exp`, `Curry`, and `Eval`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the type passed to `x` in an instance of `Eval` is correctly defined as an exponential type.
- The evaluation process within a closed diagram ensures consistency with the rules governing such diagrams, making it crucial for maintaining correct transformations.
