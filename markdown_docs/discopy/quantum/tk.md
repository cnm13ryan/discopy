### FunctionDef upgrade(tk_circuit)
**upgrade**: The function of upgrade is to convert a Pytket Circuit into a Discopy Circuit.
**parameters**: 
· tk_circuit: A :class:`pytket.Circuit` object that needs to be upgraded.

**Code Description**: This function takes a Pytket Circuit and converts it into a Discopy Circuit. The process involves iterating through each gate in the input Pytket Circuit, identifying the type of gate, and then applying an equivalent gate operation in the Discopy Circuit. Here is a detailed breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization**: A new `Circuit` object from the Discopy library is created with the same number of qubits and bits as the input Pytket Circuit.
2. **Gate Conversion**: For each gate in the Pytket Circuit, the function retrieves the type of the gate (e.g., 'Rx', 'Rz') and its parameters. It then uses this information to apply an equivalent operation in the Discopy Circuit.
3. **Return Result**: After processing all gates, the resulting Discopy Circuit is returned.

This function serves as a bridge between Pytket's circuit representation and Discopy's circuit representation, ensuring that circuits created in one framework can be seamlessly used or transformed within the other.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `tk_circuit` is correctly formatted as a Pytket Circuit before calling this function. Any unsupported gate types will raise a `NotImplementedError`.

**Output Example**: The output of the `upgrade` function would be a Discopy Circuit object with gates equivalent to those in the input Pytket Circuit, but represented using Discopy's syntax and operations. For example, if the input Pytket Circuit contains an 'Rx' gate, the resulting Discopy Circuit will have an `Rx` box applied to the corresponding qubit.
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self, n_qubits, n_bits, post_selection, scalar, post_processing)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the state of a Circuit instance.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: n_qubits (default value 0): An integer representing the number of qubits in the circuit.
· parameter2: n_bits (default value 0): An integer representing the number of classical bits in the circuit.
· parameter3: post_selection (optional, default None): A dictionary used for specifying post-selection conditions on certain qubits or bits.
· parameter4: scalar (optional, default 1): A numerical scalar value that scales the amplitude of the quantum state.
· parameter5: post_processing (optional, default Id(bit ** (n_bits - len(self.post_selection)))): An object representing a post-processing operation applied to the circuit.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the Circuit class. It sets up the initial conditions for the quantum and classical bits within the circuit. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of Post-Selection**: 
   - The `post_selection` parameter is checked to see if it has been provided. If not, it defaults to an empty dictionary `{}`.
   
2. **Setting Scalar Value**:
   - The `scalar` parameter is set to 1 by default but can be overridden with a custom scalar value.

3. **Post-Processing Initialization**:
   - The `post_processing` parameter is initialized based on the provided parameters and defaults. If no explicit post-processing object is given, it uses an identity operation (`Id`) applied to a bit tensor of size `(n_bits - len(self.post_selection))`. This ensures that if there are any post-selection conditions specified, they are accounted for in the post-processing setup.

4. **Superclass Initialization**:
   - The `super().__init__(n_qubits, n_bits)` call initializes the superclass (likely another class inheriting from Circuit) with the provided number of qubits and bits. This ensures that any additional initialization logic defined in the superclass is also executed.

This method sets up the foundational elements required for a quantum circuit, including its size, post-selection conditions, scaling factors, and post-processing operations, providing a structured starting point for further operations on the circuit.

**Note**: Ensure that if you are using custom `post_selection`, `post_processing`, or `scalar` values, they are appropriately defined before passing them to the Circuit instance. Incorrect initialization could lead to unexpected behavior in subsequent operations on the circuit.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the Circuit object that can be used to recreate the object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method provides a detailed and structured string representation of a `Circuit` object. It constructs this representation by combining several components: initialization details, gate operations, post-selection conditions, scalar values, and post-processing instructions.

1. **Initialization Details**: The method starts by creating an initial string that denotes the creation of a `tk.Circuit` object with a specified number of qubits. If there are any bits (classical bits) involved, it appends this information to the initialization string.
2. **Gate Operations**: Each gate in the circuit is represented using the `repr_gate` function, which formats the name and parameters of each gate operation. The gates are then concatenated into a single string.
3. **Post-Selection Conditions**: If there are any post-selection conditions defined for the circuit, they are included as part of the string representation.
4. **Scalar Values**: Any scalar values associated with the circuit are formatted using the `format_number` function and added to the string.
5. **Post-Processing Instructions**: Finally, if there are any post-processing instructions, these are also included in the string.

The overall structure of the returned string is a concatenation of all these components, separated by periods (`.`), which makes it clear how each part contributes to the circuit's definition.

**Functional Analysis**: 
This method plays a critical role in ensuring that `Circuit` objects can be easily recreated from their string representations. This is particularly useful for debugging and logging purposes, as well as for saving and restoring circuits in a readable format. The use of `format_number` ensures that numerical values are presented in a consistent and user-friendly manner.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the circuit's attributes such as gates, post-selection conditions, scalar values, and post-processing instructions are correctly formatted and included in the string representation.
- This method should be used whenever a detailed textual representation of a `Circuit` object is needed for documentation or logging purposes.

**Output Example**: 
For a `Circuit` with 3 qubits, no bits, one Hadamard gate on the first qubit, post-selection on the second qubit, and a scalar value of 2.5, the output might look like:
```
tk.Circuit(3).H(0).post_select({1: '0'}).scale(2.5)
```
#### FunctionDef repr_gate(gate)
**repr_gate**: The function of repr_gate is to generate a string representation of a quantum gate.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: gate (QuantumGate) - A quantum gate with an operation and associated qubits and bits.

**Code Description**: 
The `repr_gate` function takes a single argument, `gate`, which represents a quantum gate. The function extracts the name of the gate's operation and its parameters from the given `gate`. It then constructs a string representation of the gate by combining the operation name with its parameters in a formatted manner.

1. **Step 1**: Extracting the Operation Type
   ```python
   name, inputs = gate.op.type.name, gate.op.params + [x.index[0] for x in gate.qubits + gate.bits]
   ```
   - `gate.op.type.name` retrieves the type of operation performed by the gate.
   - The parameters are collected from both qubits and bits. For each qubit or bit, `x.index[0]` is appended to the list of inputs.

2. **Step 2**: Constructing the String Representation
   ```python
   return f"{name}({', '.join(map(str, inputs))})"
   ```
   - The operation name and its parameters are combined into a string using an f-string.
   - `map(str, inputs)` ensures that all elements in the `inputs` list are converted to strings before joining them with commas.

**Note**: Ensure that the gate object passed is correctly initialized and contains valid qubits and bits. Also, be mindful of any custom types used for `gate.qubits` and `gate.bits` as they might require additional handling or type checking.

**Output Example**: 
If a gate named "CNOT" with two inputs (0 and 1) is passed to the function, it will return the string `"CNOT(0, 1)"`.
***
***
### FunctionDef __getstate__(self)
**__getstate__**: The function of __getstate__ is to serialize the state of an instance of the Circuit class.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__getstate__` method is used during the process of pickling (serializing) an object. It returns a dictionary containing the state of the object, which can be used to reconstruct it later. In this implementation, the method first calls the `__getstate__` method of its superclass (`super().__getstate__()`) to get the initial state. Then, it updates this state with any additional attributes specific to the Circuit class using `self.__dict__`. This ensures that all relevant data is included in the serialized representation.
The method returns a dictionary containing both the inherited and custom state information.

**Note**: 
- The `super().__getstate__()` call must be used to ensure that the superclass's state is also captured, preventing any potential issues with missing attributes during unpickling.
- This method should only include attributes that can be serialized. Attributes that are not serializable or have complex structures (like methods) should not be included directly.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming an instance of Circuit named 'circuit'
state = circuit.__getstate__()
# Possible output:
# state: {'super_state': {'a': 1, 'b': [2, 3]}, '__dict__': {'custom_attribute': 'value'}}
```
This example shows that the state dictionary includes both the superclass's state and the instance-specific attributes.
***
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a dictionary format.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: state (The state dictionary containing the serialized attributes of the object.)

**Code Description**: This method is used in conjunction with `__getstate__` for implementing custom serialization and deserialization. Here’s how it works:

- The `__setstate__` function takes a single argument, `state`, which is expected to be a dictionary containing the serialized state of the object.
- It iterates over a predefined list of attributes: 'scalar', 'post_selection', 'post_processing'. For each attribute in this list:
  - It uses `getattr` and `setattr` to retrieve and set the corresponding value from the `state` dictionary. The values are popped off the state dictionary one by one, ensuring that all necessary attributes are restored.
- After setting these specific attributes, it calls the superclass's `__setstate__` method using `super().__setstate__(state)`. This is a common pattern to ensure that any additional attributes or states required by the parent class are also properly set.

This approach ensures that custom objects can be serialized and deserialized while maintaining compatibility with standard object serialization mechanisms provided by Python.

**Note**: When using this function, it's crucial to ensure that the `state` dictionary contains all necessary keys for proper restoration of the object state. Additionally, if any new attributes are added to the class in future updates, they must be included in the list passed to `__setstate__` to avoid losing data during deserialization.
***
### FunctionDef n_bits(self)
**n_bits**: The function of n_bits is to return the number of bits in a circuit.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `n_bits` method returns the total number of bits present in the current quantum circuit. It achieves this by returning the length of the `bits` attribute, which stores all the bit units used in the circuit. The `bits` attribute is a list that contains instances of the Bit class, representing each qubit and classical bit in the circuit.

This method is crucial for various operations within the circuit, such as ensuring that sufficient space is allocated for all bits, managing the renaming and addition of new bits during transformations, or validating the consistency of the circuit structure. The `n_bits` function is called by other methods like `prepare_bits` to determine the starting point for bit manipulation and in `from_tk` to manage the conversion from tket circuits to discopy circuits.

**Note**: Ensure that the `bits` attribute is properly initialized before calling this method, as it relies on the presence of this list to calculate the number of bits. Also, be aware that any changes made to the `bits` list after the initial call to `n_bits` may affect its return value.
**Output Example**: If a circuit has 5 qubits and 3 classical bits, then calling `circuit.n_bits()` will return `8`.
***
### FunctionDef add_bit(self, unit, offset)
**add_bit**: The function of add_bit is to add a bit to the circuit and update post_processing accordingly.
**parameters**:
· unit: The new bit that needs to be added to the circuit.
· offset: An optional parameter representing an offset for updating the post_processing.

**Code Description**: 
The `add_bit` method in the `Circuit` class is responsible for adding a new bit to the quantum circuit and adjusting the post-processing logic based on whether an offset is provided. Here's a detailed analysis of its functionality:

1. **Parameter Handling**: The function takes two parameters: `unit`, which represents the new bit being added, and `offset`, which is optional.
2. **Post-Processing Update**: If an `offset` is specified, it updates the post-processing logic by inserting an identity transformation (`Id(bit)`) at the given offset in the circuit's post-processing diagram. Subsequently, it swaps the identities of bits within a specific range to ensure correct connectivity and processing order.
3. **Superclass Call**: Finally, it calls `super().add_bit(unit)` to add the bit according to the inherited method from its superclass.

**Relation with Callers in the Project**:
- The `prepare_bits` function in `tk.py` uses `add_bit` when preparing bits for a quantum circuit by adding new bits and updating post-processing. This ensures that the circuit is correctly configured based on the box's codomain size.
- The `measure_qubits` function also utilizes `add_bit`, but it does so with an optional offset to account for specific measurement positions in the circuit. It updates both the circuit's bit set and the qubit set, ensuring that measurements are properly recorded and post-selection conditions are applied.

**Note**: When using `add_bit`, ensure that the `offset` parameter is correctly specified if necessary, as it can significantly affect how the post-processing diagram is updated. Incorrect handling of the offset might lead to incorrect circuit configurations or processing issues.
***
### FunctionDef rename_units(self, renaming)
**rename_units**: The function of rename_units is to update the names of specific units (bits or qubits) within a quantum circuit based on a provided renaming dictionary.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `self` - A reference to the current instance of the Circuit class.
· parameter2: `renaming` - A dictionary where keys are old unit labels and values are new labels for those units. The function ensures that only bits involved in post-selection are renamed, updating both their names and associated post-selection conditions.

**Code Description**: 
The `rename_units` method performs the following operations:
- **Identify Units to Rename**: It first identifies which bit units need renaming by checking if they exist in the provided `renaming` dictionary. Specifically, it looks for Bit instances where the old unit's index is present in the post-selection conditions of the current circuit.
- **Update Post-Selection Conditions**: For each identified bit that needs renaming, it updates the post-selection conditions to reflect the new names by creating a new dictionary (`post_selection_renaming`) and then updating the `self.post_selection` attribute with these changes. This ensures that any constraints or conditions related to these bits are correctly updated.
- **Remove Old Entries**: It removes the old bit units from the post-selection conditions to avoid redundancy.

This method is called by other functions in the project, such as `prepare_qubits`, `prepare_bits`, and `swap`. These functions use `rename_units` to rename qubits or bits according to specific rules before making further modifications to the circuit. For example:
- In `prepare_qubits`, it renames qubits based on a given offset and box size.
- In `prepare_bits`, it renames bits similarly but operates on bit units instead of qubit units.
- The `swap` function uses `rename_units` three times to swap two unit labels, ensuring that the renaming process is consistent across different operations.

**Note**: When using this method, ensure that the provided `renaming` dictionary correctly maps old and new labels. Also, be aware that modifying post-selection conditions can affect the interpretation of certain quantum circuits, so it's crucial to maintain consistency with other parts of your circuit design.

### FunctionDef post_select(self, post_selection)
**post_select**: The function of `post_select` is to post-select bits on a given value.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `post_selection`: A dictionary specifying which bits should be selected and their corresponding values.

**Code Description**: 
The `post_select` method updates the internal state of the circuit by applying post-selection. Post-selection involves filtering out measurements that do not match the specified bit string, effectively discarding all measurement outcomes that differ from the given value. This is particularly useful in quantum computing simulations where certain states need to be conditioned upon.

This function is called within the `measure_qubits` method, which handles the process of measuring qubits and updating bits accordingly. Specifically, when a `Measure` box with overridden bits is encountered, the `post_select` method is invoked to apply post-selection rules to the measured bits. This ensures that only measurement outcomes matching the specified bit string are considered valid.

In the context of `measure_qubits`, if the `box` parameter is an instance of `Measure` and has its `override_bits` attribute set, a loop iterates over each qubit being measured. For each qubit, it updates the circuit with a measurement operation and then applies post-selection using the `post_select` method. If the `box` is also an instance of `Bra`, the post-selection dictionary is used to filter out any invalid measurement outcomes.

**Note**: Ensure that the `post_selection` dictionary provided as an argument correctly matches the bits being measured; otherwise, incorrect filtering may occur, leading to erroneous simulation results.

**Output Example**: The function returns the current circuit object (`self`), allowing for method chaining. For example:
```python
tk_circ = Circuit().measure_qubits(qubits, bits, box).post_select({0: 1})
```
In this case, after measuring qubits and applying post-selection on bit 0 with value 1, the circuit will only consider outcomes where bit 0 is measured as 1.

**parameters**:
· self: An instance of the Circuit class that represents the main quantum circuit.
· others: Additional instances of the Circuit class representing other circuits to be processed concurrently with the main circuit. These can be used for comparing or processing multiple circuits simultaneously.
· backend: The backend on which the circuits will be executed (default is None, meaning it uses the default backend).
· n_shots: The number of shots (or measurements) to perform (default is 2^10).

4. **Execution**: The circuits are processed using the backend with `n_shots` number of shots and a given seed for reproducibility if provided. This returns handles that represent the execution status of each circuit.
5. **Result Collection**: For each handle, the result is retrieved from the backend and converted to counts (a dictionary mapping bitstrings to their frequencies).
6. **Normalization**: If `normalize` is True, the counts are normalized into probability distributions using the `probs_from_counts` function.
7. **Post-selection**: If `post_select` is True, post-selection based on the specified conditions in each circuit's `post_selection` attribute is applied to filter and update the counts.
8. **Scaling**: If `scale` is True, each count is scaled by the scalar value associated with the respective circuit.

**Note**: Ensure that the backend supports the quantum circuits being executed; otherwise, an error might occur. Also, be mindful of the memory usage when dealing with a large number of shots and multiple circuits.

**Output Example**: 
```python
[
    {'00': 512, '11': 488}, # Counts for the main circuit after normalization and post-selection
    {'00': 520, '11': 480}  # Counts for an additional circuit after normalization and post-selection
]
```
This example shows a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents the counts (bitstrings as keys and their frequencies as values) of one or more quantum circuits.

### FunctionDef remove_ket1(box)
**remove_ket1**: The function of `remove_ket1` is to modify a quantum gate operation by applying an identity tensor followed by X-gates based on the bitstring of a Ket.
**Parameters**:
· box: A QuantumGate instance, specifically a Ket in this context.

**Code Description**: 
The `remove_ket1` function processes a given Ket object. If the input is not a Ket, it returns the input as is. Otherwise, it performs the following operations:

1. **Bitstring Analysis and Transformation**:
   - The function checks if the input `box` is an instance of Ket.
   - It then creates a new QuantumGate (Id) tensor, which will be used to transform the original Ket. This Id gate is constructed by tensoring X gates where X is applied only when the corresponding bit in the Ket's bitstring is 1.

2. **Application of Gates**:
   - The function returns a new Ket object that represents the result of applying the identity operation followed by the constructed X-gate sequence to the original input Ket.
   
3. **Output Construction**:
   - The output is a Ket with all qubits in state |0⟩, followed by the transformation applied by `x_gates`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input object is a Ket; otherwise, it will be returned unchanged.
- This function is useful for modifying quantum operations based on the bitstring representation of a Ket.

**Output Example**: If the input Ket has a bitstring "10", then after applying `remove_ket1`, the output would be a Ket that initially prepares all qubits in state |0⟩, followed by an X-gate applied to the first qubit (since the bitstring indicates the first qubit is 1).
***
### FunctionDef prepare_qubits(qubits, box, offset)
**prepare_qubits**: The function of prepare_qubits is to rename qubits within a quantum circuit based on specified parameters.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `qubits` - A list representing the initial qubits or their indices.
· parameter2: `box` - An object that defines the size and context for renaming qubits, typically used in defining new qubit labels.
· parameter3: `offset` - An integer indicating the starting point from which to rename qubits. If `offset` is 0 or not provided, the function starts renaming from the first available qubit.

**Code Description**: 
The `prepare_qubits` function performs several key operations:
1. **Initialization of Renaming Dictionary**: It initializes an empty dictionary called `renaming`, which will store old and new qubit labels.
2. **Determine Start Point for Renaming**: The starting point for renaming is determined based on the value of `offset`. If `offset` is not provided or is 0, it starts from the first available qubit. Otherwise, it starts from the qubit at index `offset - 1` plus one.
3. **Renaming Loop**: A loop iterates over a range starting from the determined `start` point up to `tk_circ.n_qubits`. For each iteration:
   - It identifies an old qubit labeled 'q' with the current index (`i`).
   - It creates a new qubit with the same label but incremented by the length of the codomain of `box`.
   - The old and new qubit labels are added to the `renaming` dictionary.
4. **Apply Renaming**: After populating the `renaming` dictionary, it calls `tk_circ.rename_units(renaming)` to update the circuit with the new qubit labels.
5. **Add Blank Wires**: It adds blank wires to the circuit corresponding to the length of the codomain of `box`.
6. **Update Qubits List**: Finally, it returns a list of updated qubits, which includes:
   - The original qubits up to the specified offset.
   - A range of new qubit indices starting from `start` and extending by the length of `box.cod`.
   - New qubit indices for any remaining qubits after the specified offset.

The function leverages the `rename_units` method, which updates the circuit based on a provided renaming dictionary. This ensures that all relevant post-selection conditions are also updated to reflect the new labels, maintaining consistency in the quantum circuit design.

**Note**: Ensure that the `offset` value is appropriate for your specific use case and that the `box.cod` length accurately reflects the number of qubits you intend to add or rename.

**Output Example**: The function returns a list of qubit indices, which could look something like this:
```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
``` 
Here, `qubits` might have initially been `[0, 1, 2]`, and the function added new qubits starting from index 4 (i.e., `start + len(box.cod)`).
***

# Documentation for `UserAuthenticationService`

## Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of our application responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures secure and reliable login and logout functionalities, providing robust mechanisms to handle user sessions and credentials.

## Key Features

- **Login**: Facilitates user login with username and password.
- **Logout**: Ends the current user session and clears related data.
- **Session Management**: Tracks active user sessions for security purposes.
- **Password Reset**: Provides a mechanism to initiate and complete password reset requests.

## Usage

### Login

To authenticate a user, the `UserAuthenticationService` is called with the username and password as parameters. Upon successful authentication, it returns a unique session token that can be used throughout the user's session.

```python
user_token = UserAuthenticationService.login(username="john_doe", password="secure_password")
```

### Logout

To end a user's session, the `UserAuthenticationService` is invoked with the session token. This clears all related data and marks the session as inactive.

```python
UserAuthenticationService.logout(session_token=user_token)
```

### Session Management

The service maintains an internal record of active sessions. You can check if a session is still valid by providing the session token.

```python
is_valid = UserAuthenticationService.is_session_valid(session_token=user_token)
```

### Password Reset

To initiate a password reset, the user's email address or username must be provided. This process sends an email with a unique link to the user for resetting their password.

```python
UserAuthenticationService.request_password_reset(username="john_doe")
```

Upon clicking the link in the received email, users can set a new password through a dedicated form.

## Dependencies

- `DatabaseManager`: For storing and retrieving user credentials.
- `EmailService`: For sending emails to users during password reset processes.

### FunctionDef swap(i, j, unit_factory)
**swap**: The function of swap is to rename two specific units (qubits or bits) within a quantum circuit.
· parameter1: `i` - An integer representing the index of the first unit to be swapped.
· parameter2: `j` - An integer representing the index of the second unit to be swapped.
· parameter3: `unit_factory=Qubit` - A factory function used to create new units if necessary, defaulting to Qubit.

**Code Description**: The `swap` function performs three consecutive renamings within a quantum circuit using the `rename_units` method. Here is a detailed breakdown of its operations:

1. **Initialization**: 
   ```python
   old, tmp, new = unit_factory(i), unit_factory('tmp', 0), unit_factory(j)
   ```
   - Three temporary units are created: `old`, which represents the first unit to be swapped (`i`-th unit), `tmp`, a placeholder unit (temporary bit with an index of 'tmp' and zero post-selection condition), and `new`, which represents the second unit to be swapped (`j`-th unit).

2. **First Renaming**:
   ```python
   tk_circ.rename_units({old: tmp})
   ```
   - The first renaming operation swaps the name of the `old` unit with that of the temporary unit `tmp`. This effectively replaces the original `i`-th unit in the circuit with a temporary placeholder.

3. **Second Renaming**:
   ```python
   tk_circ.rename_units({new: old})
   ```
   - The second renaming operation swaps the name of the `new` unit (the original `j`-th unit) with that of the now renamed `old` unit (`i`-th unit). This step completes the swap between the two units.

4. **Third Renaming**:
   ```python
   tk_circ.rename_units({tmp: new})
   ```
   - The third renaming operation swaps back the name of the temporary unit `tmp` with that of the now renamed `new` unit (the original `j`-th unit). This final step ensures that all units are correctly named and updated in the circuit.

This sequence of operations is crucial for maintaining consistency in the circuit's structure, especially when performing complex transformations or swaps between qubits or bits. The use of temporary placeholders (`tmp`) helps manage the renaming process without disrupting other parts of the circuit.

**Note**: Ensure that `tk_circ` (the quantum circuit object) and `unit_factory` are correctly defined before calling this function to avoid errors. Additionally, be mindful of the indices provided for `i` and `j` as they must correspond to valid units in the circuit.

### FunctionDef make_units_adjacent(tk_gate)
**make_units_adjacent**: The function of make_units_adjacent is to reorder qubits within a quantum gate so that all units are adjacent.
**parameters**:
· tk_gate: A QuantumGate object containing multiple qubits, where the goal is to bring all qubits into consecutive positions.

**Code Description**: 
The `make_units_adjacent` function takes a single parameter `tk_gate`, which represents a quantum gate with multiple qubits. The primary objective of this function is to reorder these qubits such that they are adjacent in sequence. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by identifying the index of the first qubit (`offset = tk_gate.qubits[0].index[0]`). This serves as a reference point for reordering subsequent qubits.

2. **Swaps Initialization**: A new `Diagram` object called `swaps` is created, which initially represents an identity operation on the qubits and bits involved in the quantum gate (`swaps = Id(qubit ** n_qubits @ bit ** n_bits)`). This will be used to accumulate the necessary swaps.

3. **Loop Through Qubits**: The function iterates through each subsequent qubit (starting from the second one) in `tk_gate.qubits[1:]`. For each qubit, it calculates the source and target indices (`source` and `target`) relative to the reference point (`offset`).

4. **Conditional Swaps**:
   - If `source < target`, a swap is needed between these two positions. The function identifies the segments of the current swaps diagram before `source`, after `target`, and in between, then creates a new swap operation.
   - If `source > target`, a different set of segments are identified, and another swap operation is created.
   - If `source == target` (units are already adjacent), no action is taken.

5. **Update Swaps Diagram**: The newly created swap operation is appended to the existing swaps diagram using the `>>` operator.

6. **Adjust Offset**: Depending on whether a swap involved the reference point, the offset value may be adjusted (`offset -= 1`).

7. **Return Values**: After processing all qubits, the function returns the final offset and the accumulated swaps diagram.

**Note**: The function assumes that `tk_gate.qubits` is a list of Qubit objects with defined indices. Additionally, it relies on the existence of a `Diagram.swap` method for creating swap operations.

**Output Example**: 
For example, if `tk_gate` has qubits at indices `[0, 3, 1]`, after processing, the function might return `(2, swaps_diagram)`, where `swaps_diagram` represents the sequence of operations needed to reorder the qubits into `[0, 1, 2]`.

## FunctionDef mockBackend
**mockBackend**: The function of mockBackend is to create a mock quantum backend that returns predefined counts.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: *counts (List[Tuple[int, int], ...])
    - A list of tuples representing the classical register values and their corresponding counts.
**Code Description**:
The `mockBackend` function takes a list of counts as input. It returns a mock backend object that can be used for testing purposes. The returned backend has two main functionalities:

1. **get_result(i)**: This method is defined within the mock backend. When called with an index `i`, it initializes a mock result and sets its `get_counts` attribute to return the count corresponding to the classical register values at position `i` in the input `counts` list.

2. The outer mock object `mock` has a method `process_circuits` that returns a list of integers ranging from 0 to the length of the counts list minus one, which simulates processing multiple circuits.
   - This is particularly useful for testing scenarios where multiple quantum circuits need to be processed and their results obtained.

3. The mock backend object also has an attribute `get_result`, which points to the inner method defined earlier, allowing it to return specific counts based on the classical register values.

This function is commonly used in test cases to simulate expected behavior of a real quantum backend without needing actual hardware or complex setup.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input list `counts` contains valid classical register values and their corresponding counts.
- The returned mock backend can be directly used with any quantum circuit evaluation functions for testing purposes, as it mimics the output format typically expected from a real backend.

**Output Example**:
For an input of `mockBackend({(0, 0): 240, (0, 1): 242, (1, 0): 271, (1, 1): 271})`, the mock backend will return counts as specified when queried with corresponding classical register values. For example, calling `get_result(0)` would return a result where `get_counts()` returns `{(0, 0): 240}`.
### FunctionDef get_result(i)
**get_result**: The function of get_result is to mock the result of a quantum computation.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: i (int) - An index used to retrieve specific counts from a predefined list.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_result` function serves as a mock implementation for obtaining the results of a quantum computation. It takes an integer index `i` as input and returns a mocked object representing the result of a quantum operation. The function internally uses a `Mock` object to simulate the behavior of a real quantum backend result.

1. A `Mock` object is created using the line `result = Mock()`. This creates a mock object that can be used to simulate various behaviors during testing.
2. The `get_counts` method of this mock object is configured to return predefined counts at index `i` by setting `result.get_counts.return_value = counts[i]`. Here, `counts` likely refers to a list or dictionary containing the expected counts for different quantum states.

By returning this mocked result, the function allows developers to test and validate algorithms that rely on the outcomes of quantum computations without needing an actual quantum backend. This is particularly useful in unit testing scenarios where realistic data can be simulated.

**Note**: Ensure that `counts` is defined or imported elsewhere in your codebase as it contains the expected counts for different states. The function assumes that `counts` is a list or dictionary, and the index `i` provided should be within the valid range to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: If `counts = ['01: 5', '10: 3']`, calling `get_result(0)` would return a mock object where `result.get_counts()` returns `{'01': 5}`. Calling `get_result(1)` would return another mock object with `result.get_counts()` returning `{'10': 3}`.
