### FunctionDef __init__(self, classical, quantum)
**__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize the classical and quantum dimensions for a CQ object.
**parameters**:
· `classical`: A `Dim` object representing the classical dimension, defaulting to `Dim(1)`.
· `quantum`: A `Dim` object representing the quantum dimension, defaulting to `Dim(1)`.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up the initial state of a CQ object. It takes two parameters: `classical` and `quantum`, both of which are instances of the `Dim` class from the `discopy.frobenius.Dim` module. These dimensions represent the sizes or shapes of classical and quantum parts, respectively.

The method assigns these values to instance variables `self.classical` and `self.quantum`. This ensures that every CQ object has a defined size for both its classical and quantum components from the moment it is created. The default value of `Dim(1)` means that if no specific dimensions are provided during initialization, the object will be initialized with a single classical and quantum dimension.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that you provide appropriate dimensions for both classical and quantum parts unless you need to initialize them with default values. Properly setting these dimensions is crucial for subsequent operations involving CQ objects in your application.
***
### FunctionDef to_dim(self)
**to_dim**: The function of `to_dim` is to calculate the underlying dimension of the system.
· parameter1: self (The instance of CQ)
**Code Description**: 
The `to_dim` method computes the total dimension of the quantum system by combining the classical and quantum dimensions. Specifically, it returns a new `Dim` object that represents the tensor product of the classical dimension with the square of the quantum dimension.
- **Functional Analysis**: This method is crucial for defining the overall structure of the quantum channel. The returned `Dim` object encapsulates both the classical and quantum aspects of the system, ensuring that they are appropriately combined in subsequent operations within the quantum framework.

The `to_dim` method is called by several other methods in the project:
- **Called By**: 
  - `Channel.__init__`: When initializing a channel, it ensures that the dimensions of both domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) are correctly converted to their underlying dimensions.
  - `Channel.to_tensor`: This method also relies on `to_dim` to compute the tensor representation of the channel, ensuring consistency in dimension handling.

**Note**: Ensure that the input dimensions are properly instantiated as `Dim` objects before calling `to_dim`. Additionally, be aware that the returned `Dim` object represents a composite structure combining both classical and quantum aspects of the system.
**Output Example**: For an instance `CQ(Dim(2), Dim(3))`, the output would be `Dim(2, 3, 3)`, where the first element (2) is the classical dimension, and the subsequent elements (3 and 3) represent the quantum dimensions squared.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of __eq__ is to check if two instances of CQ are equal based on their classical and quantum components.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: other - The instance of CQ to compare with.

**Code Description**:
The `__eq__` method in the `CQ` class is designed to determine whether two instances of `CQ` are equal. This comparison is based on two attributes: `classical` and `quantum`. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Type Check**: The first condition checks if `other` is an instance of `CQ` using the built-in `isinstance` function. If `other` is not an instance of `CQ`, the method returns `False`, indicating that the two instances are not equal.

2. **Classical Component Comparison**: Assuming `other` is also a `CQ` instance, the next condition compares the `classical` attribute of the current instance (`self`) with the `classical` attribute of `other`. If these attributes are not equal, the method returns `False`.

3. **Quantum Component Comparison**: Finally, the method checks if the `quantum` attribute of the current instance (`self`) is equal to the `quantum` attribute of `other`. If both conditions pass (i.e., the type check and both component comparisons are true), the method returns `True`, indicating that the two instances are considered equal.

**Note**: This implementation ensures that for two `CQ` instances to be considered equal, they must have identical classical and quantum components. Any discrepancy in these attributes will result in the instances being deemed unequal.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming c1 and c2 are instances of CQ with matching classical and quantum attributes
c1 = CQ(classical=0, quantum=[1])
c2 = CQ(classical=0, quantum=[1])

# This would return True
print(c1 == c2)

# If the classical or quantum components differ, it returns False
c3 = CQ(classical=1, quantum=[1])
print(c1 == c3)  # Returns False
```
***
### FunctionDef __hash__(self)
**__hash__**: The function of __hash__ is to return a unique hash value based on the string representation of the object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `__hash__` method in Python is used to generate a hash value for an object. In this implementation, it returns a hash value derived from the string representation (`repr`) of the object. The `repr(self)` function generates a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate the object if needed.

Here's a detailed analysis:
- **Hash Value Generation**: The method uses Python’s built-in `hash` function, which takes an argument and returns a hash value for it. In this case, the argument passed to `hash` is the string representation of the object.
- **String Representation**: `repr(self)` generates a string that represents the object in such a way that if you pass it back into the constructor, the same object can be recreated. This ensures that the hash value generated is unique and consistent for identical objects.

**Note**: 
- The returned hash value should be consistent as long as the state of the object does not change.
- If two instances of `CQ` are equal according to the equality operator (`==`), their hash values must also be the same. However, if they are not equal, there is no requirement for their hash values to differ.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `CQ` has a string representation like `<CQ object at 0x7f8b2c3d4e56>`, then calling `hash(instance)` will return the corresponding hash value based on this string. The exact output depends on the implementation details and the current state of Python's hashing mechanism, but it will be a unique integer for that specific instance.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the CQ object.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method returns a string that represents the current state of the CQ object. Specifically, it constructs and returns a formatted string that includes the classical and quantum components of the CQ object. The format of the returned string is "CQ(classical=<classical_value>, quantum=<quantum_value>)", where `<classical_value>` and `<quantum_value>` are the actual values of the `classical` and `quantum` attributes respectively.

The method uses an f-string to generate this representation, which ensures that the output string is clear and informative. This can be particularly useful for debugging or logging purposes, as it provides a concise yet comprehensive view of the object's state.
**Note**: Ensure that the `classical` and `quantum` attributes are correctly defined and accessible within the CQ class to avoid any runtime errors related to undefined attributes.
**Output Example**: If an instance of CQ has `classical=5` and `quantum=[0, 1]`, calling `__repr__` on this object would return the string "CQ(classical=5, quantum=[0, 1])".
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the CQ object.
**parameters**: There are no parameters passed to this method.
**Code Description**: This method provides a human-readable string representation of the `CQ` object based on its state. It checks whether the object has classical and/or quantum components, and formats the output accordingly.

- If both `self.classical` and `self.quantum` attributes are `False`, it returns "CQ()" indicating an empty CQ object.
- If only `self.classical` is `True` and `self.quantum` is `False`, it returns a string in the format "Q(<classical>)" where `<classical>` represents the value of `self.classical`.
- If only `self.quantum` is `True` and `self.classical` is `False`, it returns a string in the format "C(<quantum>)" where `<quantum>` represents the value of `self.quantum`.
- If both `self.classical` and `self.quantum` are `True`, it returns a string in the format "C(<classical>) @ Q(<quantum>)" indicating a composition of classical and quantum components.

**Note**: Ensure that the attributes `self.classical` and `self.quantum` are correctly set before calling this method. The method assumes these attributes are boolean values representing whether the object has classical or quantum data, respectively.
**Output Example**: 
- If `self.classical = False` and `self.quantum = False`, the output will be "CQ()".
- If `self.classical = True` and `self.quantum = False`, the output will be "Q(True)".
- If `self.classical = False` and `self.quantum = True`, the output will be "C(True)".
- If both `self.classical = True` and `self.quantum = True`, the output will be "C(True) @ Q(True)".
***
### FunctionDef tensor(self)
**tensor**: The function of tensor is to compute the tensor product between a classical-quantum dimension and multiple other dimensions.
· parameter1: others - This parameter takes one or more `CQ` objects with which to perform the tensor product.
**Code Description**: 
The `tensor` method computes the tensor product of a `CQ` object (representing a classical-quantum dimension) with one or more additional `CQ` objects. It ensures that each provided argument is an instance of `CQ` using the `assert_isinstance` function, which raises a `TypeError` if any argument fails this check.

The method then separately computes the tensor product for the classical and quantum parts of the input dimensions:
- The classical part of the current object is tensor-multiplied with the classical parts of the provided `others`.
- Similarly, the quantum part of the current object is tensor-multiplied with the quantum parts of the provided `others`.

Finally, it returns a new `CQ` object that combines these results, representing the overall tensor product of the original and additional dimensions.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure all input arguments are instances of `CQ`.
2. The method supports multiple inputs by iterating over them using a for loop.
3. The computed classical and quantum parts are combined to form the final result.

**Output Example**: If you call `tensor` with two `CQ` objects, the output will be another `CQ` object where:
- The classical part is the tensor product of the classical parts of the input `CQ` objects.
- The quantum part is the tensor product of the quantum parts of the input `CQ` objects.
***
### FunctionDef __matmul__(self, other)
**__matmul__**: The function of __matmul__ is to compute the tensor product between a CQ object and another CQ object or multiple CQ objects.
· parameter1: other - This parameter takes one or more `CQ` objects with which to perform the tensor product.

**Code Description**: 
The `__matmul__` method checks if the provided `other` is an instance of `CQ`. If it is, the method proceeds to compute the tensor product using the `tensor` method. Otherwise, it returns `NotImplemented`.

1. **Checking Input Type**: The first line of the method uses a type check (`isinstance(other, CQ)`) to ensure that the provided argument is an instance of `CQ`. If not, the method returns `NotImplemented`, indicating that the operation cannot be performed.

2. **Tensor Product Calculation**: If the input `other` is indeed an instance of `CQ`, the method calls the `tensor` method on the current object and passes it one or more other `CQ` objects as arguments (`*others`). This effectively computes the tensor product between the classical-quantum dimensions.

3. **Classical Part Tensor Product**: The `tensor` method separately handles the classical part of the CQ object by computing its tensor product with the classical parts of the provided `others`. It uses a generator expression to extract the classical parts from each input and then applies the `tensor` operation across these parts.

4. **Quantum Part Tensor Product**: Similarly, the quantum part of the current CQ object is tensor-multiplied with the quantum parts of the provided `others`. The process is analogous to that for the classical part but operates on the quantum dimensions instead.

5. **Combining Results**: After computing both the classical and quantum tensor products, a new `CQ` object is created using these results. This new `CQ` object encapsulates the combined classical and quantum parts, representing the overall tensor product of the original dimension with the provided inputs.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that all input arguments are instances of `CQ`.
2. The method supports multiple inputs by iterating over them.
3. The computed classical and quantum parts are combined to form the final result.

**Output Example**: If you call `__matmul__` on a `CQ` object with another `CQ` object, the output will be another `CQ` object where:
- The classical part is the tensor product of the classical parts of the input `CQ` objects.
- The quantum part is the tensor product of the quantum parts of the input `CQ` objects.

### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return the dagger (adjoint) of the current channel.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Channel class.

**Code Description**: The `dagger` method returns a new Channel object that represents the adjoint (or dagger) of the original channel. This operation involves taking the conjugate transpose of the underlying tensor representation and then constructing a new Channel with updated domain and codomain.
- **Functional Analysis**: 
  - **to_tensor() Call**: The `self.to_tensor()` method is called, which converts the current Channel into its underlying Tensor form. The resulting tensor undergoes a conjugate transpose operation using `.dagger()`.
  - **Array Update**: The array of the resulting tensor after the conjugate transpose is used to construct the new Channel.
  - **Domain and Codomain Preservation**: The domain (`self.dom`) and codomain (`self.cod`) of the original channel are preserved in the new Channel, ensuring that the adjoint operation respects the input-output relationship.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `to_tensor` method correctly handles the conversion to a tensor form before applying the conjugate transpose.
- The resulting Channel should have its domain and codomain swapped compared to the original Channel, as is typical for adjoint operations in quantum computing or linear algebra contexts.
- This method assumes that the underlying array representation supports complex numbers, as the conjugate transpose operation involves complex conjugation.

**Output Example**: 
If the original channel has a domain of `2` and a codomain of `3`, the resulting daggered channel will have a domain of `3` and a codomain of `2`. The array used to construct this new Channel is obtained by taking the conjugate transpose of the original array.

`calculateDiscount` is a function designed to compute the discount amount based on the original price of an item and the specified discount rate.

## Function Signature

```python
def calculateDiscount(original_price: float, discount_rate: float) -> float:
```

## Parameters

- **original_price**: A `float` representing the initial price of the item before any discounts are applied. The value must be non-negative.
- **discount_rate**: A `float` indicating the percentage discount to be applied. This value should be between 0 and 1 (inclusive), where 0.2 represents a 20% discount.

## Return Value

- **float**: Returns the calculated discount amount as a floating-point number. If the input values are invalid, it returns `None`.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: Applying a 20% discount to an item priced at $50
discount_amount = calculateDiscount(50.0, 0.2)
print(discount_amount)  # Output: 10.0

# Example 2: Attempting to apply a negative discount rate (should return None)
invalid_discount = calculateDiscount(100.0, -0.1)
print(invalid_discount)  # Output: None
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `original_price` and `discount_rate` are within acceptable ranges.
- The function handles invalid inputs gracefully by returning `None`.

## Error Handling

The function includes basic error handling to manage invalid discount rates or negative prices. If an invalid input is detected, it returns `None` without raising an exception.

## Example Use Cases

1. **E-commerce Pricing**: Calculate discounts for online shopping.
2. **Retail Sales**: Determine the reduction in price during sales events.
3. **Financial Analysis**: Estimate savings based on different discount scenarios.

## Dependencies

### FunctionDef encode(cls, dim, constructive)
**encode**: The function of `encode` is to convert a quantum dimension into a classical one by mapping qubits to classical bits.
**Parameters**:
· dim: The dimension of the quantum system to be encoded. This parameter represents the size or complexity of the quantum state being transformed.
· destructive: A boolean value indicating whether the encoding process should discard the original quantum information after conversion.

**Code Description**: 
The `encode` function in this context is designed to transform a quantum dimension into its classical representation, ensuring that qubits are mapped to classical bits. This transformation can be crucial for various quantum computing tasks where classical processing is required. The function operates based on whether the encoding process should be destructive or non-destructive.

1. **Initial Condition Check**: If `dim` is empty (i.e., no qubits), the function returns an identity channel, indicating that no transformation is needed.
2. **Recursive Measurement**: For dimensions with more than one element, the function recursively measures each part of the dimension separately and combines them using the composition operation (`@`). This ensures that all parts of the quantum state are accounted for during the encoding process.
3. **Single-Qubit Encoding**:
   - **Destructive Encoding**: If `destructive` is set to `True`, the function constructs a mapping array where each element represents whether the corresponding classical bit matches the qubit being measured. This results in a channel that effectively discards the quantum state after measurement.
     ```python
     array = [
         int(i == j == k)
         for i in range(n)
         for j in range(n)
         for k in range(n)]
     return cls(array, Q(dim), C(dim))
     ```
   - **Non-Destructive Encoding**: If `destructive` is set to `False`, the function constructs a more complex mapping array that accounts for multiple qubits and their classical counterparts. This ensures that both pre- and post-measurement states are preserved in the channel representation.
     ```python
     array = [
         int(i == j == k == l == m)
         for i in range(n)
         for j in range(n)
         for k in range(n)
         for l in range(n)
         for m in range(n)]
     return cls(array, Q(dim), C(dim) @ Q(dim))
     ```

**Note**: 
- The `dim` parameter should be a valid quantum dimension, and the `destructive` flag must be set appropriately based on the requirements of the application.
- The function relies on the `cls`, `Q`, and `C` classes from its calling context to define the channel structure.

**Output Example**: 
If `dim` is `(2)` (indicating a two-qubit system) and `destructive` is `True`, the output would be a channel that maps each qubit measurement outcome to classical bits, effectively discarding any remaining quantum state. The array used for this mapping would contain values indicating matches between measured states and classical bits:
```python
array = [
    1 if i == j else 0
    for i in range(2)
    for j in range(2)]
```
This results in a channel that can be represented as `cls(array, Q((2)), C((2)))`.

   - **Description**: Initiates a process for users to reset their forgotten passwords.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `username` (string): The username or email address of the user who forgot their password.
   - **Returns**:
     - `ResetToken`: A token used to initiate the password reset process.

#### Example Usage

```python
# Authenticate a user and create a session
user_details = UserAuthenticationService.authenticateUser("john.doe@example.com", "password123")
session_token = UserAuthenticationService.createSession(user_details.userId)

# Change the user's password
success = UserAuthenticationService.changePassword(user_details.userId, "password123", "newpassword456")

# Request a password reset token
reset_token = UserAuthenticationService.forgotPassword("john.doe@example.com")
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, including passwords and session tokens, are encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login attempts.
- **Session Expiry**: Sessions expire after a period of inactivity to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

#### Dependencies
- Database Service: For storing user credentials and managing session tokens.
- Email Service: For sending password reset emails.

#### Methods

1. **authenticateUser**
   - **Description**: Validates a user's credentials against the stored data.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `userName` (String): The username or email address of the user attempting to log in.
     - `password` (String): The password provided by the user.
   - **Return Type**: Boolean
     - True if authentication is successful; False otherwise.

2. **createSession**
   - **Description**: Creates a session for an authenticated user, generating a unique session token and storing it securely.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `userId` (String): The ID of the user whose session is being created.
   - **Return Type**: String
     - A unique session token that can be used to identify the user during subsequent requests.

3. **validateSession**
   - **Description**: Verifies the validity of a session token.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `sessionToken` (String): The session token to validate.
   - **Return Type**: Boolean
     - True if the session is valid; False otherwise.

4. **logoutUser**
   - **Description**: Logs out a user by invalidating their session token.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `userId` (String): The ID of the user whose session needs to be invalidated.
   - **Return Type**: None

#### Example Usage

```python
# Authenticate a user
isAuthenticated = UserAuthentication.authenticateUser("john_doe@example.com", "securePassword123")
if isAuthenticated:
    print("Login successful.")
    # Create a session for the authenticated user
    sessionToken = UserAuthentication.createSession("1234567890")
    print(f"Session token: {sessionToken}")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")

# Validate the session
isValid = UserAuthentication.validateSession(sessionToken)
if isValid:
    print("Session is valid.")
else:
    print("Session expired or invalid.")

# Log out the user
UserAuthentication.logoutUser("1234567890")
```

#### Security Considerations

- **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Session Management**: Session tokens are generated randomly and stored in a secure manner. Sessions expire after a period of inactivity or can be manually invalidated.

This documentation provides clear instructions on how the `UserAuthentication` object functions, ensuring that developers understand its purpose and usage effectively.
