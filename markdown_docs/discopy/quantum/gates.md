## FunctionDef format_number(data)
**format_number**: The function of format_number is to try formatting a number into a string representation.
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: data (The input data that needs to be formatted)

**Code Description**: 
- This function attempts to format the given `data` using Python's f-string with format specifier `.3g`. The purpose is to represent numbers in a concise and readable form, suitable for display. If `data` is not a number or cannot be formatted as expected (raising a `TypeError`), it simply returns the original `data`.
- This function is commonly used in contexts where numerical values need to be displayed in a user-friendly manner without unnecessary precision.

**Functional Analysis**: 
The `format_number` function plays a crucial role in ensuring that numbers are presented in a consistent and readable format across various parts of the quantum computing library. It is called by multiple classes such as `Parametrized`, `Scalar`, `Sqrt`, and `Circuit`. In these contexts, it ensures that numerical parameters or values are displayed appropriately when creating string representations or drawing visualizations.

For instance:
- In `Parametrized.__str__` and `Parametrized.__repr__`, `format_number(self.data)` is used to format the parameter value for display. This helps in maintaining a consistent style of showing parameter values, whether they are part of a textual representation or a more formal object representation.
- Similarly, in `Scalar.__init__` and `Scalar.__str__`, as well as `Sqrt.__init__`, `format_number(data)` is utilized to ensure that scalar values or square root operations involving parameters are displayed correctly.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input data type is compatible with string formatting. If the data cannot be formatted, it will return the original value.
- This function should be used in scenarios where numerical values need to be displayed in a user-friendly manner without losing essential information through excessive precision.

**Output Example**: 
If `data` is 1234567890, the output might be "1.23e+09". If `data` is 0.000123456, it might return "1.23e-04". For non-numerical types or if formatting fails, the original input will be returned.

### FunctionDef conjugate(self)
**conjugate**: The function of conjugate is to return the conjugate of the controlled gate.
**parameters**: This Function does not accept any parameters.
**Code Description**: In the `Controlled` class, the `conjugate` method computes and returns the conjugate of the controlled gate. It achieves this by applying a complex conjugation operation to the phase angle of the controlled gate's matrix representation while keeping its structure intact. This is crucial for operations such as adjoint gates in quantum circuits.
This method plays a vital role when constructing and manipulating quantum circuits, ensuring that the resulting circuit remains unitary and preserves the integrity of the quantum state transformations.

The `conjugate` method interacts with other parts of the project in several ways:
- **test/quantum/circuit.py/test_adjoint**: The test case verifies that for every gate in the list `gates`, its conjugate is correctly computed. Specifically, it checks if applying the `conjugate` method to each gate yields the corresponding element from the `gates_conj` list. This ensures that the implementation of the `conjugate` method is correct and consistent with expectations.

**Note**: Ensure that the complex conjugation operation is applied correctly to all relevant matrix elements, particularly those involving phase angles.
**Output Example**: For a controlled gate defined by an angle θ, the output of `conjugate` would be a controlled gate defined by -θ. For example, if the original controlled gate was `Controlled(Rz(0.3), distance=-1)`, the conjugated version would be `Controlled(Rz(-0.3), distance=-1)`.
***
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return the adjoint (or dagger) of the current SelfConjugate instance.
· parameter1: left (Boolean)
    - This parameter is not used within the method and is simply deleted.

**Code Description**: The `rotate` method in the `SelfConjugate` class returns a new instance where the internal operation has been adjointed. Specifically, it calls the `dagger()` method on the current instance to compute its conjugate transpose. Since this method does not use the `left` parameter and always returns the result of calling `self.dagger()`, it effectively provides an inverse or reverse version of the original gate.

The relationship with its callees in the project can be understood as follows:
- The `rotate` method relies on the `dagger()` method to compute the adjoint. This `dagger` method is likely defined in a superclass or another relevant class, such as `Swap`, `Box`, or `Controlled`. In this context, it ensures that each gate can have its own specific behavior for computing the dagger.
- The use of `rotate` suggests that the current instance represents some form of operation (like a swap or a controlled gate) that needs to be reversed. By returning the adjoint, it allows for the construction of inverse circuits or operations in quantum computing.

**Note**: Ensure that the internal operation supported by `SelfConjugate` instances has a properly defined `dagger` method. This is crucial because the `rotate` function relies on this method being implemented correctly to generate valid inverse operations.
**Output Example**: If `self` represents a gate instance, then calling `rotate()` will return another instance of `SelfConjugate` where the internal operation has been adjointed. For example:
```python
original_gate = SelfConjugate(some_operation)
adjoint_gate = original_gate.rotate()
```
In this case, `adjoint_gate` would be the inverse or reverse version of `original_gate`.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return the current AntiConjugate object without any modifications based on the `left` parameter.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (bool) - This parameter is currently not utilized within the function and is passed through for potential future use or compatibility with a similar method.

**Code Description**:
The `rotate` function in the context of the AntiConjugate class does not perform any operations that alter the state of the object. Instead, it simply returns the current instance of the AntiConjugate object. The parameter `left`, which is expected to be a boolean value, is explicitly deleted within the function body using `del left`. This deletion suggests that the parameter might have been intended for future functionality or was passed through from another method call but is not used in this particular implementation.

This design choice indicates that the function may serve as a placeholder or a convention in a larger system where such parameters are expected, even though they are not utilized here. It could also be part of an interface that might change in the future to include additional functionality related to `left`.

**Note**:

    id=new_profile.id,
   
### FunctionDef __init__(self, dom)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Discard gate with a specified domain.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: dom (default value: 1)
    - This parameter specifies the domain of the Discard gate, which can be an integer or a Quantum object. If it is an integer, it will be converted into a tensor product of qubits using `qubit ** dom`.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method initializes the Discard gate with the given domain and sets up its properties.

1. It first checks if the provided `dom` parameter is an instance of `int`. If so, it converts this integer to a tensor product of `qubit` objects using `qubit ** dom`.
2. The super class's __init__ method is then called with formatted string `"Discard({dom})"`, where `{dom}` represents the domain value after conversion if necessary.
3. It initializes the gate’s properties such as its name, input and output domains (which are both set to `qubit ** 0` since a Discard gate typically discards qubits), and sets `is_mixed` to `True`.
4. The number of qubits in the domain is calculated using `len(dom)` and stored in the attribute `self.n_qubits`.

**Note**: When creating an instance of the Discard class, ensure that the provided `dom` parameter is either a valid integer or a Quantum object representing the domain. If it's not an integer, the method will assume it’s already in the correct form. The `is_mixed=True` setting indicates that this gate can be part of mixed states or probabilistic scenarios, which might be relevant for certain quantum computations.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to return the adjoint state corresponding to the current mixed state.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method returns an instance of `MixedState` with codomain equal to the dual of the domain of the current object. In other words, it computes the Hermitian conjugate (or adjoint) of the mixed state. For a Discard gate, its dagger operation results in a MixedState on the specified number of qubits.

This method is called by the `test_Discard` function in the `circuit.py` test file, where it verifies that the dagger of a Discard returns a MixedState and vice versa. This relationship ensures consistency between the operations of discarding information and restoring a mixed state, which are fundamental concepts in quantum computing.

**Note**: Ensure that the input to the `MixedState` constructor is correctly specified when calling `dagger`. The test cases in `circuit.py` demonstrate this usage effectively.
**Output Example**: If you call `discard = Discard(); discard.dagger()`, it will return a `MixedState` object with the codomain equal to the domain of the original Discard. For example, if the Discard was defined on 2 qubits (`discard = Discard(2)`), its dagger would produce a MixedState on 2 qubits as well.
***
### FunctionDef _decompose(self)
**_decompose**: The function of _decompose is to return an Id tensor product with multiple Discard gates.
**Parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `_decompose` method within the `Discard` class returns a composed quantum gate operation. Specifically, it constructs and returns an identity gate (`Id()`) tensor product with a sequence of `Discard` gates repeated `n_qubits` times. The `Id()` gate represents the identity transformation in quantum computing, meaning that applying this gate to any qubit state leaves the state unchanged. By using the `tensor` method, these identity and discard operations are combined into a single composite operation.

The use of the `*` operator and the `Discard()` constructor within the list comprehension `[Discard()] * self.n_qubits` creates a list containing `n_qubits` instances of the `Discard` gate. The `tensor` method then combines these gates in sequence, effectively creating a quantum circuit that first applies the identity operation to each qubit and then discards all qubits.

This approach is useful for decomposing more complex quantum operations into simpler components or for representing certain types of quantum error correction procedures where specific qubits need to be discarded after some processing.
**Note**: Ensure that `self.n_qubits` is properly initialized and represents the number of qubits involved in the operation. Misalignment between the expected number of qubits and the actual circuit can lead to incorrect decompositions.

**Output Example**: If `self.n_qubits = 3`, `_decompose()` would return an object equivalent to `Id().tensor(Discard(), Discard(), Discard())`. This results in a quantum gate operation that first applies the identity transformation to three qubits and then discards them.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, cod)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a MixedState object.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: cod (default value 1)
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `MixedState` class. It takes a single argument, `cod`, which defaults to 1. The purpose of this constructor is to set up the initial state and configuration of the MixedState object.

Upon initialization, it first checks if `cod` is an integer. If so, it converts `cod` into a tensor product of qubits using `qubit ** cod`. This step ensures that the `cod` parameter can be either a single value or a more complex quantum state represented by multiple qubits.

Next, the super class's constructor (`super().__init__`) is called with several arguments:
- A string representation of the object in the format `"MixedState({cod})"`.
- An identity operation on a single qubit, represented as `qubit ** 0`.
- The quantum codimension `cod`, which defines the dimensionality of the state space.
- A boolean flag `is_mixed` set to `True`, indicating that this is a mixed state rather than a pure state.

After setting up these initial configurations, two additional attributes are assigned:
- `self.drawing_name` is set to `"MixedState"`. This attribute likely controls how the object is represented visually or in diagrams.
- If `cod` equals `bit`, which seems to be a predefined quantum bit (qubit) constant, then `self.drawing_name` is reset to an empty string (`""`) and two more attributes are set: `draw_as_spider` to `True` and `color` to `"black"`. These settings might indicate specific visual representation rules for certain states.

This method ensures that the MixedState object is properly initialized with the correct quantum state, dimensions, and visual representation properties.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return the conjugate transpose of the current MixedState.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the MixedState class.

**Code Description**: The `dagger` method in the MixedState class returns another MixedState object that represents the conjugate transpose (or adjoint) of the current state. This operation is fundamental in quantum computing, where it corresponds to taking the Hermitian adjoint of a quantum state or operator. In this context, the `dagger` method essentially flips the complex conjugates and transposes the matrix representation of the MixedState.

This function interacts with the Discard class through its call to `MixedState(self.dom)`, which returns an instance of MixedState using the domain (`dom`) of the current Discard object. This interaction is crucial for maintaining consistency in quantum operations, as the dagger operation on a discard state should result in a mixed state that represents the marginal distribution.

The `dagger` method also has implications when called by other parts of the project, such as in the test cases provided in `circuit.py`. Specifically, the assertion in `test_Discard` ensures that the conjugate transpose of a Discard object results in a MixedState and vice versa. This relationship is important for validating the correctness of quantum circuit operations.

**Note**: Ensure that the domain (`dom`) passed to the MixedState constructor accurately represents the dimensionality of the state space, as this affects the resulting mixed state's properties.

**Output Example**: The output will be an instance of `MixedState` with the same domain (`dom`) as the current Discard object. For example:
```python
discard_instance = Discard()
mixed_state_result = discard_instance.dagger()  # Returns a MixedState with the same domain as discard_instance.
```
***
### FunctionDef _decompose(self)
**_decompose**: The function of _decompose is to return an Id tensor product gate applied to multiple MixedState gates corresponding to the length of the codomain of the current MixedState.

**Parameters**:
· self: An instance of the MixedState class, representing a mixed quantum state.

**Code Description**: 
The `_decompose` method constructs and returns a quantum circuit consisting of an identity gate (Id) followed by a tensor product of multiple `MixedState` gates. The number of `MixedState` gates is determined by the length of the codomain (`cod`) of the current MixedState instance.

Here's a detailed analysis:
- **Initialization**: The method starts with an `Id()` object, which represents an identity gate in quantum computing.
- **Loop Construction**: A loop iterates over the range defined by the length of the codomain (`len(self.cod)`). For each iteration, a new `MixedState` instance is created and added to the tensor product using the `*=` operator. This effectively builds up a sequence of `MixedState` gates.
- **Tensor Product**: The `Id()` gate is then tensored with this sequence of `MixedState` gates. The result is a quantum circuit that can be used to represent the decomposition of the current MixedState into simpler operations.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the codomain length (`len(self.cod)`) is correctly determined before calling `_decompose`.
- This method assumes that the `MixedState` and `Id` classes are properly defined elsewhere in the codebase, with appropriate methods for tensor product construction.

**Output Example**: If an instance of MixedState has a codomain length of 3, then `_decompose` would return an object equivalent to:
```
Id().tensor(MixedState()).tensor(MixedState()).tensor(MixedState())
```

### FunctionDef __init__(self, n_qubits, destructive, override_bits)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Measure gate instance.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: n_qubits (default value = 1) - An integer specifying the number of qubits to measure.
· parameter2: destructive (default value = True) - A boolean indicating whether the measurement should be destructive, meaning that after measuring, the qubits are set to their measured state.
· parameter3: override_bits (default value = False) - A boolean indicating whether to override the bits with the measurement results.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method of the Measure class is responsible for setting up a new instance of the Measure gate. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of Domain and Codomain**: The first lines of the function define the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) using the `qubit` and `bit` types, raised to the power of `n_qubits`. This effectively sets up the input and output spaces for the gate.
2. **Name Construction**: A name is constructed based on the number of qubits being measured. If only one qubit is involved (i.e., `n_qubits == 1`), no additional characters are added to the name; otherwise, the number of qubits is included in the name.
3. **Non-Destructive Measurement Handling**: If `destructive` is set to False, the codomain (`cod`) is modified by adding a bit type for each qubit, indicating that the measurement will not destroy the state of the qubits after measurement. The name is also adjusted accordingly.
4. **Override Bits Handling**: If `override_bits` is True, the domain (`dom`) is expanded to include bits for each qubit, meaning that the original qubit states are replaced with their measured values upon measurement. Again, the name is updated to reflect this change.
5. **Superclass Initialization**: The `super().__init__()` call initializes the Measure gate using the constructed name, domain, and codomain, marking it as a mixed state (`is_mixed=True`).
6. **Instance Attributes Assignment**: The method sets instance attributes for `destructive`, `override_bits`, and `n_qubits`.
7. **Drawing Settings**: Finally, the attribute `draw_as_measures` is set to True, indicating that when visualizing this gate, it should be drawn as a measurement.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `qubit` and `bit` types are properly defined in your codebase or imported from an appropriate module.
- The `is_mixed=True` parameter indicates that the Measure gate is considered to be in a mixed state, which might have implications for how it interacts with other quantum gates or circuits.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return the adjoint (or Hermitian conjugate) of an Encode gate.
**Parameters**: The parameters of this Function are:
· n_bits: int, the number of qubits to encode, default value is 1.
· constructive: bool, optional, whether to do a classically-controlled correction instead; default value is True.
· reset_bits: bool, optional, whether to reset the bits to the uniform distribution; default value is False.

**Code Description**: The `dagger` method in the `Measure` class returns an instance of the `Encode` gate with parameters modified as follows:
- `constructive` is set to the original value of `self.destructive`.
- `reset_bits` is set to the original value of `self.override_bits`.

This method effectively computes the adjoint operation for a measure gate, converting it into an encode gate with adjusted parameters. This is useful in quantum computing operations where the dual operation of encoding qubits needs to be performed.

**Note**: The `dagger` method is called by the test function `test_Measure` within the file `circuit.py`. In this context, it verifies that the adjoint of a measure gate (with certain parameters) correctly maps back to an encode gate with corresponding parameters. This ensures that the operations are correctly reversed and can be used in reverse computations or error correction processes.

**Output Example**: If you call `Measure(destructive=False, override_bits=True).dagger()`, it will return an instance of `Encode` with `constructive=False` and `reset_bits=True`. Similarly, calling `Encode().dagger()` will return a `Measure` object.
***
### FunctionDef _decompose(self)
**_decompose**: The function of _decompose is to return a tensor product of Measure gates.
**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `_decompose` method returns an `Id()` gate (which typically represents the identity operation) tensored with multiple instances of the `Measure` gate. These `Measure` gates are created using the properties specified in the object, such as `destructive` and `override_bits`, and repeated for a total number of qubits defined by `self.n_qubits`. Essentially, this method decomposes the overall operation into its constituent parts to facilitate further manipulation or visualization.

The function starts with creating an identity gate (`Id()`) using the `tensor` method. It then generates multiple instances of the `Measure` gate based on the number of qubits specified by `self.n_qubits`. The `Measure` gates are constructed with specific parameters: `destructive`, which determines whether the measurement is destructive or not, and `override_bits`, which allows overriding certain bits during the measurement process. These generated `Measure` gates are then combined using the tensor product operation (`*`) to form a composite gate.

**Note**: Ensure that the properties `destructive`, `override_bits`, and `n_qubits` are properly set before calling `_decompose`. The function assumes these attributes are available within the object's context.
**Output Example**: If an instance of the `Measure` class has `self.destructive = True`, `self.override_bits = [0, 1]`, and `self.n_qubits = 2`, then `_decompose` would return a gate equivalent to `Id().tensor(Measure(destructive=True, override_bits=[0, 1]), Measure(destructive=True, override_bits=[0, 1]))`.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, n_bits, constructive, reset_bits)
**__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize an instance of the `Encode` class.
**parameters**:
· n_bits: An integer specifying the number of qubits to encode (default value is 1).
· constructive: A boolean indicating whether the encoding process should be constructive (default value is True).
· reset_bits: A boolean flag determining whether bits should be reset after encoding (default value is False).

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Encode` class. It sets up the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) based on the number of qubits specified by `n_bits`. The name for the gate instance is derived from a `Measure` object, with certain modifications to reflect the characteristics of constructive encoding and whether bits should be reset.

1. **Domain and Codomain Setup**: 
   - `dom` is set as `bit ** n_bits`, representing the bit domain.
   - `cod` is set as `qubit ** n_bits`, indicating the qubit codomain.
   
2. **Name Construction**:
   - The name for the gate instance is created by replacing "Measure" with "Encode" in the original `name`.
   - If `constructive` is not True, it modifies the name to reflect non-destructive behavior.
   - If `reset_bits` is True, it includes this information in the name.

3. **Superclass Initialization**:
   - The method then calls the superclass's `__init__` using `super().__init__(name, dom, cod, is_mixed=True)`, setting up the base class attributes.
   
4. **Instance Attributes Assignment**:
   - The method assigns the values of `constructive` and `reset_bits` to corresponding instance variables for later use.
   - It also sets `n_bits` as an instance attribute.

5. **Relationship with Callees**:
   - This method interacts with the `Measure` class, utilizing its functionality to construct the name and setup the domain and codomain.
   - The `Measure` class is responsible for defining the basic structure of a measurement gate, which is then adapted by `Encode`.

**Note**: Ensure that the values passed to `constructive` and `reset_bits` are correctly set according to the intended behavior of the encoding operation. Misconfiguration can lead to incorrect gate definitions in quantum circuits.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return the Hermitian adjoint (or dagger) of the current measurement operation.
**parameters**: 
· n_qubits: int - The number of qubits being measured, which defaults to 1 if not specified.
· constructive: bool - Whether the resulting operation should be non-destructive. This parameter defaults to `self.destructive` (the default destructive state from the original operation).
· reset_bits: bool - Whether to override input bits with new ones after measurement. This parameter defaults to `self.override_bits`, which is the standard behavior of tket.
**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method in the `Measure` class returns an instance of the `Encode` class, representing the Hermitian adjoint (or dagger) operation of the current measurement. The returned `Encode` object has parameters that are derived from the original `Measure` instance:
- `n_qubits`: It is set to match the number of qubits being measured.
- `constructive`: This parameter is set to the inverse of `destructive`, indicating a non-destructive operation if the original was destructive and vice versa.
- `reset_bits`: This parameter retains the behavior specified in the original `Measure` instance, allowing for potential bit overriding after measurement.

This method effectively provides a way to reverse the action of a measurement by encoding qubits back into their initial state, which is crucial in quantum circuit design and simulation. The relationship with other functions such as `test_Measure` ensures that the behavior of these operations is correctly validated.

**Note**: Ensure that when using this function, you have properly initialized an instance of `Measure` before calling `dagger`. Also, be aware that the parameters passed to `Encode` are derived from the internal state of the `Measure` object and may need to be adjusted based on specific use cases.
**Output Example**: 
If a `Measure` instance is created with `destructive=False` and `override_bits=True`, calling its `dagger` method will return an `Encode` instance with `constructive=True` and `reset_bits=True`.
***
### FunctionDef _decompose(self)
**_decompose**: The function of _decompose is to break down an Encode gate into a sequence of basic quantum gates.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any external parameters; it uses instance variables defined within its class context.
· parameter1: self.constructive - A boolean indicating whether the decomposition should be constructive (i.e., creating additional qubits if necessary).
· parameter2: self.reset_bits - An integer representing the number of bits to reset during the decomposition process.
· parameter3: self.n_bits - An integer specifying the total number of bits involved in the decomposition.

**Code Description**: The _decompose method constructs a sequence of gates that represent the decomposition of an Encode gate. It creates `self.n_bits` instances of the Encode gate, each configured with the same properties (`constructive` and `reset_bits`). These encoded gates are then combined using the tensor product operation, resulting in a composite quantum circuit.

The Id() object is used as the starting point for the decomposition process, meaning that the sequence begins with an identity gate (Id()). This identity gate ensures that the initial state of the qubits is preserved before the Encode gates are applied. The `*` operator is used to repeat the sequence of Encode gates `self.n_bits` times.

The resulting quantum circuit represents a series of Encode operations, each potentially creating or resetting bits according to the specified parameters. This decomposition is useful for breaking down complex operations into simpler components that can be more easily analyzed or simulated.

**Note**: Ensure that the instance variables `constructive`, `reset_bits`, and `n_bits` are properly set before calling this method. Additionally, verify that these values make sense in the context of your quantum circuit design to avoid errors or unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: If `self.n_bits = 3`, `self.constructive = True`, and `self.reset_bits = 1`, then `_decompose` would return a quantum circuit equivalent to:
```
Id() ⊗ (Encode(True, 1) ⊗ Encode(True, 1) ⊗ Encode(True, 1))
```

***
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a dictionary containing its serialized representation.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: state (dict) - A dictionary that contains the serialized state of the object, typically obtained through serialization mechanisms like pickling.

**Code Description**: 
The `__setstate__` method in the `QuantumGate` class is responsible for reconstructing an instance from a dictionary (`state`) that was previously serialized. This method ensures that the object can be restored to its correct state after being deserialized, handling specific cases related to gate data and names.

1. **Handling Array Data**: 
   ```python

   ```
   This conditional block checks if the `_array` key exists in the `state` dictionary and ensures that it is not `None`. If both conditions are met, the data from the `_array` is flattened (converted to a 1D array) and then converted to a list. The resulting list is assigned to the `data` attribute of the object.

2. **Handling Gate Name Data**: 
   ```python
   if "_name" in state:
       if state["_name"] in GATES and hasattr(
               GATES[state["_name"]], "data"):
           state["data"] = copy.deepcopy(GATES[state["_name"]].data)
           state["_z"] = GATES[state["_name"]].z
   ```
   This block handles the case where a gate name (`_name`) is present in the `state` dictionary. If the `_name` corresponds to an existing gate in the `GATES` dictionary and that gate has a `data` attribute, the method creates a deep copy of this data and assigns it to the `data` attribute of the object. Additionally, if the gate also has a `z` attribute, its value is assigned to the `_z` state variable.

3. **Calling Parent Class Method**: 
   ```python
   super().__setstate__(state)
   ```
   Finally, the method calls the `__setstate__` method of the parent class using `super()`. This ensures that any additional state handling defined in the base class is also performed, providing a complete restoration process.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `GATES` dictionary and its contents are correctly defined elsewhere in your codebase.
- The use of deep copy (`copy.deepcopy`) when restoring gate data helps maintain the integrity of the original data by creating an independent copy.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Copy gate.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the Copy gate by calling the superclass's `__init__` method with specific arguments. Here’s a detailed analysis:
- **super().__init__("Copy", bit, bit ** 2, [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])**: This line initializes the Copy gate by passing the following parameters to the superclass constructor:
    - `"Copy"`: The name of the gate.
    - `bit`: A reference to a single qubit (or bit).
    - `bit ** 2`: A reference to a two-qubit system, indicating that this gate operates on two qubits.
    - `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`: The matrix representation of the Copy gate. This is an 8x1 complex vector (or matrix) representing a unitary transformation for copying one qubit onto another in a two-qubit system.
- **self.draw_as_spider, self.color = True, "black"**: These lines set instance variables:
    - `draw_as_spider`: A boolean indicating whether the gate should be drawn as a spider (a graphical representation often used in quantum circuit diagrams).
    - `color`: The color of the gate when it is drawn.
- **self.drawing_name = ""**: This line sets an empty string to `drawing_name`, which might be used for custom drawing names or labels on the gate.

**Note**: Ensure that all required imports and dependencies are correctly set up before using this class. The matrix representation `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` is specific to the Copy operation; make sure it matches the intended functionality of your implementation.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return an instance of `Copy`.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method within the `Match` class returns an instance of the `Copy` class. This operation essentially provides a way to get the adjoint or inverse gate of a `Match` gate, which is crucial in quantum computing for operations like reversing computations or implementing certain transformations.

In the context of quantum gates, the dagger operation typically represents the Hermitian conjugate of a matrix representing the gate. For the `Match` gate, this method returns an instance of `Copy`, indicating that the adjoint operation of matching two bits is equivalent to copying them in this specific implementation.

This function is called within the test case `test_Copy_Match`, where it asserts that the dagger of a `Match` gate results in a `Copy` gate and vice versa. This ensures that the functionality of these gates, particularly their adjoint operations, behaves as expected during testing.
**Note**: Ensure that the `dagger` method is correctly implemented to return an instance of `Copy`. The implementation should be consistent with the behavior required for quantum circuits, where dagger operations are essential for correct circuit reversibility and error correction.

**Output Example**: 
```python
match_gate = Match()
copy_gate = match_gate.dagger()  # Returns an instance of Copy
print(copy_gate)
# Output: <discopy.quantum.gates.Copy object at 0x7f8b3c3d5e10>
```

This example demonstrates that the `dagger` method correctly returns a `Copy` gate when called on a `Match` gate.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Match gate object.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Match` class by calling the superclass's `__init__` method with specific arguments. It then sets several attributes on the new instance, configuring its behavior and appearance.

- **super().__init__("Match", bit ** 2, bit, [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])**: This line calls the `__init__` method of the superclass with the arguments `"Match"`, `bit ** 2`, `bit`, and a list `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`. The first argument is likely the name or type of the gate, while the second and third arguments might represent some properties related to qubits. The fourth argument appears to be an initialization vector for the gate.

- **self.draw_as_spider, self.color = True, "black"**: This line sets two attributes on the current instance (`self`). `draw_as_spider` is set to `True`, indicating that this gate should be drawn as a spider in graphical representations. The `color` attribute is set to `"black"`, specifying the color of the gate in drawings.

- **self.drawing_name = ""**: This line initializes the `drawing_name` attribute, setting it to an empty string. It might be used for storing a name or label that will be displayed when drawing the gate.

**Note**: Ensure that the `bit` object is properly defined and imported before using this class. The list `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` should match the expected format for initializing the gate; otherwise, it may lead to incorrect behavior or errors.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to return an instance of the `Match` class.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method in the `Copy` class is designed to provide the dagger (or adjoint) operation. In quantum computing, the dagger operator typically represents the conjugate transpose of a matrix or gate. For the `Copy` gate, which takes a bit and returns two copies of it, its dagger operation would logically reverse this process. However, in this implementation, the `dagger` method simply returns an instance of the `Match` class.

This design choice is likely intended to maintain consistency with other gates or operations within the quantum computing framework, where the dagger method might have a specific meaning related to the adjoint or inverse operation. The use of `Match` here suggests that this gate might be part of a larger system where different operations and their adjoints are represented by distinct classes.

The method is called in the test function `test_Copy_Match`, which asserts that the dagger of `Match` returns `Copy` and vice versa, ensuring the symmetry and correctness of these operations within the quantum circuit framework.
**Note**: When implementing or using this method, ensure it aligns with the broader design principles of your quantum computing library. The return type should be consistent with other adjoint operations in the system.

**Output Example**: The output of `dagger` will always be an instance of the `Match` class, regardless of the input state. For example:
```python
copy_gate = Copy()
match_gate = copy_gate.dagger()  # match_gate is an instance of Match
```

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Digits object with specified digits, dimension, and optional dagger flag.
**Parameters**:
· *digits: A variable number of integer arguments representing the digits that make up this quantum state.
· dim: An integer specifying the dimension of each digit. If not provided, it defaults to 2.
· is_dagger: A boolean indicating whether the Digits object should be treated as a daggered version (default is False).

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method initializes a `Digits` object by setting its attributes and constructing the corresponding domain and codomain for a quantum circuit. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Type Check and Error Handling**:
   - It first checks if `dim` is an integer using `isinstance(dim, int)`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`, ensuring that only valid dimension values are accepted.

2. **Initialization of Attributes**:
   - The method initializes two attributes: `_digits` to store the given digits and `_dim` to hold the dimension value.
   - It converts the digits into a string representation for display purposes using f-strings, such as "bit" when `dim == 2`.

3. **Domain and Codomain Construction**:
   - The method constructs the domain and codomain of the Digits object based on the provided dimensions. This is crucial for representing quantum states in a circuit.
   - If `dim` equals 2, it sets the name to "bit"; otherwise, it uses a custom string representation.

4. **Superclass Initialization**:
   - The method calls the superclass's `__init__` using `super().__init__(name, dim)`, initializing the object with a name and dimension.
   - It also handles state restoration by checking for a `_dim` attribute in the state dictionary during deserialization (`__setstate__`) to ensure backward compatibility.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all digits passed are valid integers. Invalid dimensions will result in a `TypeError`.
- The use of f-string formatting and the custom name construction help maintain clarity in representing different types of Digits.
- The method's interaction with the superclass ensures proper initialization and representation within the broader context of quantum circuit operations.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Digits instance.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method returns a string that represents the current state of the Digits instance. If the `is_dagger` attribute is set to `True`, it appends ".dagger()" to the name; otherwise, no additional text is added. This string representation can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- The first part of the return statement concatenates the `name` attribute of the Digits instance with an optional suffix based on the value of `is_dagger`.
- If `is_dagger` is `True`, ".dagger()" is appended to the name, indicating that this digit represents a daggered state.
- If `is_dagger` is `False`, no additional text is added after the name.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `name` attribute and `is_dagger` property are properly set for each Digits instance before calling `__repr__`.
- This method should be used to generate a meaningful string representation of the object, which can help in understanding the state or identity of the Digits instance.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of Digits has `name = "0"` and `is_dagger = False`, then `__repr__` would return `"0"`. If `is_dagger = True`, it would return `"0.dagger()"`.
***
### FunctionDef dim(self)
**dim**: The function of dim is to return the dimension of the information units.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `dim` method returns the dimension of the information units represented by the current instance of the `Digits` class. It accesses the private attribute `_dim`, which presumably holds the value representing the dimension, and returns it. The docstring provides a simple assertion example to illustrate that for the `Bits(1, 0)` object, its dimension is 2.

This method is called by the `dagger` method of the same class, where it is used to determine the dimension of the daggered state. This indicates that the dimension is an important characteristic of the quantum states being manipulated and is preserved or referenced in operations like taking the dagger (adjoint) of a quantum gate.

**Note**: Ensure that the private attribute `_dim` is correctly set for each instance of `Digits`, as it forms the basis for this method's functionality. The value should accurately represent the dimensionality of the state, which is crucial for correctness in quantum operations.

**Output Example**: 
If an instance of `Digits` is created with a specific configuration that corresponds to a two-dimensional space (e.g., representing a qubit), calling `dim()` on this instance will return `2`. For example:
```python
digit_instance = Digits(1, 0)
assert digit_instance.dim == 2
```

This output confirms the dimension of the state represented by `digit_instance`, which is essential for understanding and performing operations within the quantum computing context.
***
### FunctionDef digits(self)
**digits**: The function of digits is to return the list representation of the classical state.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `digits` method returns a list that represents the digits of a classical state. It achieves this by converting the internal `_digits` attribute, which presumably holds the digit values, into a Python list using the built-in `list()` function and then returning it.

This method is called in several contexts within the project:
- In the `dagger` method of the `Digits` class, where it retrieves the digits to create the dagger operation.
- In the test function `test_Digits`, which verifies that the `digits` method correctly returns a list of expected values and ensures that applying the dagger operation twice results in the original state.

The relationship with its callers can be understood as follows:
- The `dagger` method uses the digits to construct the corresponding daggered state, ensuring that operations on quantum states are properly handled.
- The test function `test_Digits` confirms that the `digits` method works correctly by checking both the value of the returned list and the behavior when applying the dagger operation.

**Note**: Ensure that the input to the `_digits` attribute is valid before calling the `digits` method, as this will directly affect the output. The test cases help validate the integrity of the implementation.
**Output Example**: If an instance of `Digits` with digits `[0, 1, 2]` and dimension `3` is created, then `d.digits` would return `[0, 1, 2]`.

### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to return the adjoint (or Hermitian conjugate) of the current quantum state.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method returns the adjoint or Hermitian conjugate of the current instance of the `Digits` class. This operation flips the phase of the quantum state and transposes it, which is a fundamental operation in quantum computing to reverse certain transformations.

- **Internal Operations**: The method constructs a new `Digits` object by using all the digits from the original instance but with the `is_dagger` attribute set to the logical negation of its current value. This attribute likely indicates whether the state has already been daggered.
  
- **Dimension Handling**: It also ensures that the dimension of the resulting state is consistent. The dimension is retrieved via the `dim` method, which accesses the private `_dim` attribute and returns it.

**Relationship with Callers and Callees**: 
- **Called by**: The `dagger` method does not directly call other methods within this class but relies on the `digits` and `dim` methods to generate its output.
  
- **Calls**: It indirectly calls the `dim` method to ensure that the dimension of the new state is correctly set. Additionally, it uses the `digits` attribute to construct the list representation of the daggered state.

**Note**: Ensure that the `_digits` and `_dim` attributes are properly initialized for each instance of `Digits`. The `is_dagger` attribute should be managed carefully to avoid incorrect states during operations. 

**Output Example**: If an instance of `Digits(1, 0)` with a dimension of 2 is created, calling `d.dagger()` will return a new `Digits` object representing the daggered state. For example:
```python
digit_instance = Digits(1, 0)
assert digit_instance.dagger().digits == [0, 1]
```
This output confirms that the original state `[1, 0]` has been correctly transformed to its adjoint form `[::-1]`, and the dimension remains consistent with the original instance.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Ket object based on a given bitstring.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: *bitstring (variable length)
    - A tuple or list containing integers 0 and 1 representing the bits of the quantum state.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in the `Ket` class is responsible for initializing an instance of a Ket object. It starts by validating that all elements within the provided bitstring are either 0 or 1, raising an exception if any other value is found. This ensures that only valid quantum bits (qubits) can be represented.

After validation, it calculates the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the Ket object using the `qubit` object, which represents a single qubit state. The domain is initialized to `qubit ** 0`, representing an empty tensor product space, while the codomain is set to `qubit ** len(bitstring)`, indicating the dimensionality based on the length of the bitstring.

A name for the Ket object is generated by converting each element in the bitstring to a string and joining them with commas. This name helps identify the state represented by the Ket object, making it easier to reference or debug.

The `__init__` method then calls the superclass's (`super().__init__`) `__init__` method, passing the generated name, domain, and codomain as arguments. Finally, instance variables `_digits`, `_dim`, and `draw_as_brakets` are initialized with the bitstring, its length (which is 2 for a single qubit), and a boolean value indicating whether to draw the Ket object using bra-ket notation.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that all elements in the provided *bitstring* are either 0 or 1. The method will raise an exception if any other values are present.
- The `qubit` object must be defined elsewhere in your code, as it is used to calculate the domain and codomain dimensions.
***
### FunctionDef bitstring(self)
**bitstring**: The function of bitstring is to return the bitstring representation of a Ket.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `bitstring` method converts the internal state or digits of a Ket into its corresponding bitstring representation. It achieves this by returning a list of the digits stored within the Ket object, which are essentially the binary values that represent the quantum state. This conversion is useful for visualization and debugging purposes.

The `bitstring` function is called in two other methods:
- In the `dagger` method, it is used to generate the bitstring representation of a Bra, which is the conjugate transpose of the Ket. The Bra's bitstring is derived from the Ket's bitstring by creating a new Bra object with the reversed and negated digits.
- In the `_decompose` method, it helps in decomposing the Ket into a tensor product of individual Ket objects corresponding to each digit. This decomposition aids in understanding the structure of more complex quantum states.

**Note**: Ensure that the internal state (digits) of the Ket object is correctly initialized and maintained for accurate bitstring representation. Also, be aware that the `bitstring` method returns the digits as a list, which can be directly used in other operations or visualizations.

**Output Example**: If a Ket object represents the quantum state |101>, then calling `ket.bitstring()` would return `[1, 0, 1]`.

### FunctionDef _decompose(self)
**_decompose**: The function of _decompose is to return the Ket as a tensor product of individual Ket objects corresponding to each digit in its bitstring.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `_decompose` method converts the internal state (bitstring) of a Ket object into a more detailed representation by decomposing it into a tensor product of simpler Ket objects. Specifically, for each digit `b` in the Ket's bitstring, a new Ket object is created and then all these Kets are combined using the tensor product operation (`tensor`). This process helps in breaking down complex quantum states into their constituent parts, making them easier to analyze or visualize.

The `_decompose` method works as follows:
1. It first retrieves the bitstring representation of the Ket by calling the `bitstring` method.
2. For each digit `b` in this bitstring, it creates a new Ket object using `[Ket(b) for b in self.bitstring]`.
3. These individual Kets are then combined into a single Ket object via the tensor product operation (`Id().tensor(*...)`). The `Id()` here is an identity gate which serves as the starting point of the tensor product sequence.

This decomposition is useful for understanding how complex quantum states can be built from simpler ones and aids in various operations such as state preparation, measurement, or visualizing the structure of a Ket object. It also helps in ensuring that more intricate quantum circuits can be constructed by combining basic building blocks.

**Note**: Ensure that the internal state (digits) of the Ket object is correctly initialized and maintained for accurate decomposition. Also, be aware that the `_decompose` method returns a tensor product of Kets, which can be used further in constructing larger quantum circuits or analyzing individual components of a complex state.

**Output Example**: If a Ket object represents the quantum state |101>, then calling `ket._decompose()` would return `Id().tensor(Ket(1), Ket(0), Ket(1))`.

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Bra object with a bitstring.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: *bitstring - Variable length argument that represents the input bits as either 0 or 1.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in the `Bra` class is responsible for setting up a new instance of the Bra object based on the provided bitstring. Here's a detailed analysis:

- **Input Validation**: The first line of the method checks if all elements in the *bitstring are either 0 or 1 using a list comprehension and the `all()` function. If any element is not 0 or 1, an exception is raised with a message indicating that the bitstring can only contain integers 0 or 1.
- **Name Construction**: The name of the Bra object is constructed by formatting a string that includes the bitstring in a readable form using `f"Bra({', '.join(map(str, bitstring))})"`. This helps in identifying the state represented by the Bra object.
- **Domain and Codomain Assignment**: Domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) are assigned based on the length of the *bitstring. The domain is set to `qubit ** len(bitstring)`, which means it represents a vector space with dimensions equal to the number of bits in the bitstring. The codomain is set to `qubit ** 0`, indicating that the Bra object maps to a one-dimensional vector space.
- **Superclass Initialization**: The `super().__init__(name, dom, cod)` line calls the constructor of the superclass (likely an abstract class or base class) with the constructed name and assigned domain and codomain. This ensures that any additional initialization required by the superclass is performed.
- **Instance Variables Setup**: Finally, instance variables `_digits`, `_dim`, and `draw_as_brakets` are initialized to store the bitstring, its dimension (which is 2 for a qubit), and a boolean value indicating whether the object should be drawn as a bra-ket notation.

**Note**: It's important to ensure that only valid bitstrings (containing only 0s and 1s) are provided when creating an instance of the Bra class. Additionally, understanding the domain and codomain assignments is crucial for working with quantum computing concepts like vector spaces and linear transformations.

### FunctionDef bitstring(self)
**bitstring**: The function of bitstring is to return the bitstring representation of a Bra.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `bitstring` method returns the bitstring representation of a Bra, which is essentially a list of digits representing the state vector in binary form. In quantum computing, a Bra represents the dual object to a Ket and is used to describe the input or output states of qubits. The `_digits` attribute likely holds these digit values that are converted into a bitstring.

This method is crucial for understanding the state representation of a Bra in terms of its binary digits. It allows developers to inspect and manipulate the state of quantum bits (qubits) represented by the Bra object, facilitating debugging and analysis during development or testing phases.

The `bitstring` function is called within other methods such as `_decompose`, which uses it to create decomposed quantum circuits. In particular, the `dagger` method also relies on `bitstring` to generate a corresponding Ket state from the Bra's bitstring representation.

**Note**: Ensure that the `_digits` attribute is properly populated before calling the `bitstring` method. If not, this method will return an empty list or incorrect values, leading to misinterpretation of the quantum state.

**Output Example**: 
If a Bra object represents the state vector `[1, 0, 1]`, then calling `bra.bitstring()` would return the list `['1', '0', '1']`. This output can be used for further processing or visualization purposes in quantum circuit simulations.

***
### FunctionDef _decompose(self)
**_decompose**: The function of _decompose is to return the decomposition of a Bra into a tensor product of individual Bra gates.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `_decompose` method within the `Bra` class returns a quantum circuit that decomposes the state represented by the Bra object. Specifically, it constructs a sequence of single-qubit Bra gates corresponding to each digit in the bitstring representation of the Bra. This process is essential for breaking down complex quantum states into simpler components for analysis or further processing.

The implementation uses the `Id().tensor()` method from the Discopy library, which creates an identity gate and then tensors it with a series of individual Bra gates. The list comprehension `[Bra(b) for b in self.bitstring]` generates a list of Bra gates based on each digit in the bitstring representation of the current Bra object.

The `_decompose` method is closely related to other methods such as `bitstring`, which provides the necessary state information (i.e., the bitstring). The `bitstring` method returns the binary digits representing the quantum state, and these are used by `_decompose` to create a corresponding sequence of Bra gates.

**Note**: Ensure that the `_digits` attribute is properly populated before calling the `_decompose` method. If not, this method will return an identity gate tensor with no actual decomposition, leading to incorrect circuit representations.

**Output Example**: 
If a Bra object represents the state vector `[1, 0, 1]`, then calling `bra._decompose()` would return a quantum circuit equivalent to `Id().tensor(Bra('1')).tensor(Bra('0')).tensor(Bra('1'))`. This output can be used for further processing or visualization purposes in quantum circuit simulations.

***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to return the dagger (conjugate transpose) of the controlled gate.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: The `dagger` method returns another Controlled gate with its internal gate's dagger operation and the same distance attribute. The `self.controlled.dagger()` call computes the conjugate transpose of the inner gate, which is then used to construct a new Controlled gate object with the same distance as the original one.
The method ensures that the resulting gate can be used in quantum circuits where the adjoint (dagger) operation is required for operations such as Hermitian conjugation or implementing inverse transformations.

This function is called by several other methods and functions within the project, including `rotate`, `conjugate`, and test cases involving classical gates and quantum circuits. For example, the `rotate` method uses `self.dagger()` to compute its own adjoint operation, which is a common practice in quantum computing where operations need to be reversed or inverted.

**Note**: Ensure that the Controlled gate's inner gate supports the dagger operation, as this function relies on it being defined and implemented correctly. Additionally, pay attention to the distance attribute, which should remain unchanged during the conjugation process.
**Output Example**: If `self.controlled` is a Controlled gate with an inner gate `gate`, then calling `dagger()` will return another Controlled gate where the inner gate is `gate.dagger()`. The distance attribute of the returned Controlled gate remains the same as that of the original one.
***
### FunctionDef conjugate(self)
**conjugate**: The function of conjugate is to compute the complex conjugate of the current controlled gate.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the Controlled class on which the method is called.

**Code Description**: 
The `conjugate` method computes the complex conjugate of a given controlled gate. It first creates a new controlled gate by calling the `conjugate` method on the `controlled` attribute, which represents the inner gate being controlled. Then, it returns a new Controlled object with this conjugated inner gate and a negative distance value (`-self.distance`). The distance parameter is likely used to track some property of the gate that should be reversed when taking the conjugate.

This method is called in the `test_adjoint` function where it is verified that the conjugate of each gate matches the corresponding element in the `gates_conj` list. This ensures that the implementation of the `conjugate` method correctly computes the complex conjugate for all types of gates, including controlled gates.

**Note**: The distance parameter should be set appropriately to reflect the properties of the original gate when computing its conjugate. Ensure that this value is consistent with the physical or mathematical meaning of the gate's operation.

**Output Example**: 
If `self` represents a Controlled gate with an inner gate and a positive distance, calling `conjugate()` will return a new Controlled gate where the inner gate has been conjugated (its phases reversed), and the distance is negated. For example:
```python
original_gate = Controlled(Rx(0.1), distance=2)
conjugated_gate = original_gate.conjugate()  # Returns Controlled(Rx(-0.1), distance=-2)
```
***
### FunctionDef lambdify(self)
**lambdify**: The function of `lambdify` is to convert a quantum gate operation into a callable Python function that can be evaluated with specific input values.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: *symbols, **kwargs
    - *symbols: A variable number of symbols (usually representing the parameters of the quantum gate) that will be used as inputs when evaluating the resulting callable function.
    - **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass through to `lambdify` from SymPy. This can include options like 'dtype', which specifies the data type for the output.

**Code Description**: The `lambdify` method in the `Controlled` class is designed to generate a callable Python function that represents the controlled version of another quantum gate (which is itself an instance of some other gate). Here's how it works:

1. **Controlled Operation**: It first calls the `controlled.lambdify(*symbols)` method on the current object, which returns a callable function representing the controlled version of the underlying gate.
2. **Lambda Function Creation**: This returned callable is then wrapped in another lambda function that takes variable arguments (`*xs`), ensuring flexibility in how many and what kind of inputs can be passed to it.
3. **Return Value**: The final return value is a new lambda function, which when called with specific input values (e.g., the parameters `*xs`), will execute the controlled gate operation using those inputs and return the result.

This method is particularly useful for integrating symbolic quantum operations into numerical computations or simulations where actual numeric evaluations are required. It leverages SymPy's `lambdify` functionality to convert symbolic expressions into callable Python functions, making it easier to handle both theoretical and practical aspects of quantum gate operations.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the underlying controlled operation is correctly defined before calling this method.
- The `distance` attribute used in the `Controlled` class initialization might be relevant for certain types of controlled gates but isn't directly involved in the `lambdify` process itself. However, it can affect how the gate behaves during simulation or evaluation.

**Output Example**: 
If you have a ControlledRotation gate with an angle parameter `phi`, calling `ControlledRotation(phi).lambdify(phi)(0)` would return a callable function that, when evaluated at `phi=0`, performs the controlled rotation operation and returns the resulting quantum state. For instance:
```python
result = ControlledRotation(phi).lambdify(phi)(np.pi / 2)
```
This will apply a controlled rotation with an angle of π/2 to the quantum circuit, effectively performing a specific transformation on the qubits involved in the controlled operation.
***
### FunctionDef subs(self)
**subs**: The function of subs is to substitute input arguments into the controlled gate.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: *args - Variable number of positional arguments representing parameters to be substituted.

**Code Description**: 
The `subs` method takes variable numbers of positional arguments and substitutes them in the current instance of the `Controlled` class. It then returns a new instance of the same type as the original, with the substitutions applied. The substitution is performed on the underlying controlled gate (`self.controlled`) before creating a new `Controlled` object.

This method is particularly useful for dynamically modifying quantum circuits by substituting specific parameters or values in gates that are part of these circuits. For example, it can be used to replace angles or other variables with concrete numerical values during execution.

The `subs` method interacts closely with the test cases provided:
- In `test_subs`, it verifies the functionality of substitution for single and multi-parameter gates.
- In `test_controlled_subs`, it checks how substitutions work within controlled operations, ensuring that the controlled nature is preserved while substituting parameters in the underlying gate.

**Note**: Ensure that the number and type of arguments passed match those expected by the underlying gate. Incorrect or mismatched arguments can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: If `self` represents a `CRz(phi)` instance, calling `subs(phi, 0.1)` will return a new `CRz(0.1)` instance, effectively substituting the angle `phi` with `0.1`.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to return a string representation of the Controlled gate object.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__repr__` method is defined to provide a human-readable string that represents the current state of the `Controlled` gate object. Specifically, it returns a formatted string that includes the controlled qubit and the distance (the number of qubits between the control and target qubits) as arguments passed to the `Controlled` constructor.

The method uses an f-string to format the output. Inside the f-string:
- `self.controlled!r` retrieves the representation of the controlled qubit, using the `!r` flag which ensures that the controlled qubit is represented in a way that is unambiguous (typically using the `repr()` function).
- `self.distance!r` retrieves the representation of the distance between the control and target qubits.

This string representation can be useful for debugging or logging purposes, as it provides a clear indication of how the Controlled gate was constructed.
**Note**: Ensure that both `self.controlled` and `self.distance` attributes are correctly defined and initialized in the `Controlled` class to avoid runtime errors. The `!r` flag ensures that these values are represented accurately.

**Output Example**: If an instance of the `Controlled` gate is created with a controlled qubit named 'q0' and a distance of 3, the output would be:
```
Controlled('q0', distance=3)
```
***
### FunctionDef __str__(self)
**__str__**: The function of __str__ is to return a string representation of the Controlled gate.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `__str__` method provides a human-readable string representation of an instance of the `Controlled` class. It returns different strings based on the value of the `distance` attribute:
- If `self.distance == 1`, it simply returns the `name` attribute of the Controlled gate.
- Otherwise, it returns a formatted string that includes the name "Controlled", followed by the `controlled` parameter and the `distance` value.

Detailed Analysis:
The method checks if the `distance` attribute is equal to 1. If so, it directly returns the `name` attribute, which typically represents the type or label of the gate. This could be useful for simple cases where the Controlled operation involves only one distance level.
If the `distance` attribute has a value greater than 1, the method constructs and returns a string that includes additional information about the controlled operation. The formatted string provides clarity on both the nature of the control (indicated by "Controlled") and the specific distance parameter, which is crucial for understanding more complex Controlled operations.

**Note**: Ensure that `name`, `controlled`, and `distance` attributes are properly defined in the class to avoid runtime errors.
**Output Example**: 
- If an instance has a `name` of 'X', a `controlled` value of 'Y', and a `distance` of 1, calling `__str__` on this instance will return `'X'`.
- If the same instance had a `distance` of 2, calling `__str__` would return `'Controlled(Y, distance=2)'`.
***
### FunctionDef __eq__(self, other)
**__eq__**: The function of `__eq__` is to compare two Controlled objects for equality based on their properties.
· parameter1: other (The object to be compared with)
**Code Description**: The `__eq__` method in the `Controlled` class is designed to check if the current instance (`self`) is equal to another object (`other`). It performs this comparison by first ensuring that `other` is not an instance of `Box`. If `other` is a `Box`, it delegates the comparison to the superclass's `__eq__` method. Otherwise, if `other` is an instance of `Controlled`, it further checks whether the distances and controlled properties match.
- The distance property likely represents some structural or positional information within the circuit diagram.
- The controlled property indicates whether the object is a control gate in a quantum circuit.

The comparison logic ensures that two Controlled objects are considered equal only if they have the same `distance` and `controlled` attributes, which implies that their structural positions and roles in the circuit are identical.

**Note**: 
1. Ensure that both `self` and `other` are instances of `Controlled` before performing the comparison to avoid type errors.
2. The method assumes that the `distance` and `controlled` properties are correctly implemented and meaningful for the objects being compared.

**Output Example**: The return value is a boolean indicating whether the two Controlled objects are equal based on their `distance` and `controlled` attributes. For example:
```python
# Assuming c1 and c2 are instances of Controlled with matching distance and controlled attributes
assert c1 == c2  # Returns True

# If distance or controlled attributes differ, it returns False
c3 = c1.copy()  # Create a new instance with the same properties but different object identity
assert not (c1 == c3)  # Returns False due to object identity difference even though properties are the same
```
***
### FunctionDef phase(self)
**phase**: The function of phase is to return the controlled phase operation.
**parameters**: No parameters are required for this Function.
**Code Description**: 
The `phase` method returns the phase operation associated with the current Controlled gate instance. This method is called internally during the decomposition process of certain quantum gates, specifically within the `_decompose_grad` function.

In the context of the project, when the `_decompose_grad` function encounters a Controlled gate where the controlled part is an `Rx` or `Rz` gate, it needs to decompose this operation into a series of simpler quantum operations. The phase value obtained from the current instance's `phase` method is crucial for constructing these decomposed operations.

The process involves creating a sequence of gates that effectively implement the original Controlled gate using basic quantum logic gates (such as `X`, `Rz`, and Hadamard (`H`) gates). This decomposition helps in understanding how complex quantum operations can be broken down into more fundamental components, which is essential for both educational purposes and practical implementation in quantum computing.

The phase value plays a key role in determining the angles at which certain rotation gates are applied during this decomposition. Specifically:
- It uses `Rz(-phase / 2)` to introduce a negative half of the phase angle.
- It then applies `Rz(phase / 2)` to complete the phase adjustment.
- The controlled `X` gate is used to control these operations.

If the controlled part of the gate is an `Rx` gate, additional Hadamard gates are added before and after the decomposed sequence to ensure proper operation.

This method ensures that the complex Controlled gate can be represented as a series of basic quantum logic gates, making it easier to simulate or implement in a quantum computing environment.
**Note**: Ensure that the phase value returned by `phase` is correctly computed and consistent with the overall structure of the Controlled gate. Any discrepancies might lead to incorrect decompositions.
**Output Example**: The output of the `phase` method will be a float representing the phase angle associated with the Controlled gate, which can then be used in further quantum operations during decomposition.

### FunctionDef subs(self)
**subs**: The function of `subs` is to recursively substitute values within nested data structures.

**Parameters**:
· `args`: A variable number of arguments representing key-value pairs for substitution. If the first argument in `args` is not iterable, it gets wrapped into a single-element tuple.

**Code Description**: 
The `subs` method performs recursive substitutions on the internal data structure of an object derived from `Parametrized`. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Check and Preparation of Arguments**: The function first checks if the second argument (`args`) is an iterable but not a mapping (dictionary). If so, it wraps this single-element into a tuple to ensure consistent handling.

2. **Key-Value Pair Extraction**: It then extracts keys and values from `args` using `zip(*args)`.

3. **Recursive Application of Substitution**: The function applies the substitution recursively by using `lambdify(keys, x)(*values)`. This creates a lambda function that substitutes each key with its corresponding value in `x`, and then applies this lambda function to every element within the input data.

4. **Returning the Transformed Data**: Finally, the transformed data structure (which could be a dictionary, list, tuple, set, etc., depending on the input) is returned.

The `subs` method relies on the `rmap` utility from `discopy.utils.rmap`, which ensures that substitutions are applied correctly through all levels of nested structures. This functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where deep transformations need to be performed on complex data hierarchies within quantum gate definitions or other parametrized objects.

**Note**: The use of `subs` should be carefully considered, as it can significantly alter the internal state of an object derived from `Parametrized`. Ensure that the key-value pairs provided are appropriate for the structure being transformed to avoid unintended side effects.

**Output Example**: 
Given the input:
```python
data = {'A': [0, 1, 2], 'B': ({'C': 3, 'D': [4, 5, 6]}, 7)}
args = ('x', 10)
```
The output would be:
```python
{'A': [10, 10, 10], 'B': ({'C': 10, 'D': [10, 10, 10]}, 10)}
```

This example demonstrates how `subs` can replace all occurrences of the key `'x'` with the value `10`, effectively substituting values within nested dictionaries and lists.

**Caller Analysis**: 
The `subs` method is called by the `ControlledRotation` class, which inherits from both `Controlled` and `Rotation`. This indicates that it is used in scenarios where quantum gates need to be controlled or rotated with specific parameters. The usage of `subs` ensures that these parameters can be dynamically substituted within complex gate definitions.

**Callee Analysis**: 
The `subs` method calls the `rmap` function from `discopy.utils.rmap`, which handles the recursive application of substitutions across nested data structures. This integration allows for flexible and powerful manipulation of quantum gate configurations or other parametrized objects.

By leveraging `subs`, developers can easily adapt and personalize quantum gates according to specific requirements, making it a versatile tool within the project's framework.

### FunctionDef from_tree(cls, tree)
**from_tree**: The function of `from_tree` is to instantiate a `Rotation` object from a given tree structure.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: `tree`: A dictionary representing the tree structure from which the `Rotation` object will be instantiated.

**Code Description**: 
The `from_tree` method takes a single argument, `tree`, which is expected to be a dictionary. This dictionary should contain at least one key-value pair where the key is `'data'`. The value associated with this key will be used as the data for the `Rotation` object. Additionally, if the dictionary contains a key `'z'`, its corresponding value (which must be an integer) will be used to initialize the z attribute of the `Rotation` object; otherwise, the default value 0 is assigned.

The method returns a new instance of the `Rotation` class with the provided data and optional z parameter. This approach allows for flexible initialization based on tree-like structures commonly found in quantum computing algorithms or similar applications where hierarchical data needs to be transformed into objects.

**Note**: Ensure that the input dictionary contains the required key `'data'`. The presence of the `'z'` key is optional, but if it exists, its value must be an integer. If any other keys are present in the `tree` dictionary, they will not affect the instantiation process and can safely be ignored.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example input tree structure
tree = {'data': 'rotation_angle', 'z': 45}

# Instantiation using from_tree method
rotation_instance = Rotation.from_tree(tree)

# rotation_instance would now have:
# - data attribute set to 'rotation_angle'
# - z attribute set to 45 (if the default value was not used)
```
***
### FunctionDef phase(self)
**phase**: The function of phase is to return the phase angle associated with a rotation gate.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `phase` method returns the phase attribute stored within the instance. In the context of quantum computing, this phase value represents a crucial parameter used in defining rotation gates. It essentially encodes how much the state vector should be rotated around an axis.

This function is called by other methods such as `dagger`, which computes the Hermitian conjugate (or dagger) of the gate, and `rotate`, which constructs another type of rotation gate with a modified phase value. The `grad` method also relies on this phase to compute gradients for optimization purposes. 

The phase angle is fundamental in quantum gates because it influences how states are transformed during computations. For instance, changes in the phase can affect interference patterns and thus the overall behavior of quantum algorithms.

**Note**: Ensure that the phase value is correctly set when initializing a `Rotation` object, as this directly impacts the rotation performed by the gate.
**Output Example**: If an instance's phase attribute is set to 0.5, then calling `.phase()` will return `0.5`.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to compute the Hermitian conjugate (or dagger) of a rotation gate.
· parameter1: self

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method computes the Hermitian conjugate, or dagger, of a rotation gate. It takes no additional parameters besides `self`, which refers to the current instance of the `Rotation` class. The method returns a new `Rotation` object with the phase attribute negated, i.e., `-self.phase`.

This operation is significant in quantum computing as it helps in creating adjoint gates, which are essential for certain computations and optimizations within quantum circuits. By negating the phase value, the gate effectively performs an inverse rotation, which can be crucial for operations like implementing controlled gates or optimizing circuit designs.

The `dagger` method interacts with other methods such as `phase`, which provides the phase angle of the rotation gate. The relationship between these functions is that the `phase` attribute defines how much a state vector should be rotated, and negating this value in the `dagger` operation effectively reverses the direction or nature of the rotation.

**Note**: Ensure that the phase value is correctly set when initializing a `Rotation` object to avoid incorrect behavior during dagger operations. The phase angle is fundamental as it directly influences how states are transformed during computations.

**Output Example**: If an instance's phase attribute is set to 0.5, then calling `.dagger()` will return a new `Rotation` object with its phase attribute set to `-0.5`.
***
### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to construct another type of rotation gate with a modified phase value.
**parameters**: 
· left: A boolean parameter that defaults to False. This parameter is currently not utilized within the method.

**Code Description**: The `rotate` method in the `Rotation` class is responsible for creating a new instance of the `Rotation` class with an altered phase value based on the current state of the object. Specifically, it toggles the `z` attribute (which likely represents whether the rotation should be around the z-axis) and returns a new `Rotation` instance.

The method starts by ignoring the `left` parameter, indicated by the line `del left`. This suggests that the `left` parameter might have been intended for some other use but is not necessary in this context. The core functionality of the method lies in the return statement: 
```python
return type(self)(self.phase, z=int(not self.z))
```
This line creates a new instance of the same class (`type(self)`) using the current phase value (`self.phase`) and the negated `z` attribute (converted to an integer). The use of `int()` ensures that `z` is either 0 or 1, which are typical boolean values in Python.

The relationship with other methods in the project can be inferred as follows:
- This method interacts closely with the `phase` method, which returns the phase angle associated with the rotation gate. By using this value and modifying the `z` attribute, it ensures that the new instance of the `Rotation` class represents a different rotation action.
- It is also likely called by methods such as `dagger`, which might need to manipulate the phase or axis of rotation for operations like computing the Hermitian conjugate.

**Note**: Ensure that the phase value and the `z` attribute are correctly set when initializing an instance of the `Rotation` class, as these values directly influence the behavior of the gate. The method assumes that the `left` parameter is not used, so this should be validated if it's intended for future functionality.

**Output Example**: If an instance's phase attribute is set to 0.5 and its `z` attribute is True (1), then calling `.rotate()` will return a new `Rotation` object with the same phase value of 0.5 but with `z` set to False (0).

- Regularly check the state of your DataFrame after each preprocessing step to avoid unexpected results.

By following this documentation, users can effectively preprocess their data using the `DataProcessor` class, ensuring that it meets the necessary requirements for further analysis or modeling.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, data, name, is_mixed)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Scalar object.
· parameter1: data (The input data that needs to be formatted)
· parameter2: name (Optional; default value is None, and if provided, it sets the name of the scalar)
· parameter3: is_mixed (Boolean; default value is False, indicating whether the scalar represents a mixed state)

**Code Description**: 
This `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Scalar` class. It takes three parameters: `data`, `name`, and `is_mixed`. The primary responsibilities of this method include setting up the internal state of the object to represent a scalar value in a quantum computing context.

1. **Initialization of Drawing Name**: 
   - The `drawing_name` attribute is initialized by calling `format_number(data)`. This function attempts to format the input `data` into a string representation using Python's f-string with a format specifier `.3g`, ensuring that numbers are displayed in a concise and readable form.

2. **Setting the Name**:
   - If no `name` is provided, it defaults to "scalar". Otherwise, the given `name` is used directly.

3. **Domain (Dom) and Codomain (Cod)**:
   - The domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) are both set to `qubit ** 0`, which effectively indicates that the scalar operates on a single qubit space without any additional structure or transformation applied.

4. **Inheritance from Superclass**:
   - The method calls `super().__init__(name, dom, cod, is_mixed=is_mixed, data=data, z=None)`. This line ensures that the inherited attributes and methods from the superclass are properly initialized with the provided parameters. Here, `z` is set to `None`, indicating no specific phase or additional state.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input `data` type is compatible with string formatting; otherwise, it will return the original value.
- The use of `format_number(data)` in this method ensures that scalar values are consistently displayed in a user-friendly manner across different parts of the quantum computing library. This function plays a crucial role in maintaining readability and consistency when representing numerical parameters or values visually.

For instance:
- If `data` is 1234567890, it might be formatted as "1.23e+09".
- For non-numerical types or if formatting fails, the original input will be returned.
- The method `__init__` is essential for creating instances of the `Scalar` class with appropriate initialization parameters, ensuring that each scalar object is correctly configured to represent its intended value and state.
***
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object that has been pickled.
**Parameters**: 
· parameter1: state (dict): A dictionary containing the state data of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The `__setstate__` method in Python is used when unpickling a class instance. This method allows subclasses to customize how their instances are restored from a pickled state. In this specific implementation, the method performs two main actions:
1. It sets the `_z` attribute of the object to `None`, indicating that this particular attribute was not present in the original state.
2. It calls the superclass's `__setstate__` method with the same `state` dictionary, ensuring that any additional attributes or state management defined by the superclass are also handled.

Here is a detailed analysis:
- **Initialization**: The line `state["_z"] = None` explicitly sets the `_z` attribute to `None`. This can be useful if `_z` was not part of the pickled state but needs to have a default value upon unpickling.
- **Superclass Call**: The line `super().__setstate__(state)` invokes the `__setstate__` method defined in the superclass. This is essential because it allows the superclass to handle any additional attributes or state that might be required for proper object restoration.

**Note**: When using this function, ensure that `_z` and all other attributes are properly managed within your class hierarchy. The use of `super().__setstate__` ensures that the entire inheritance chain is respected during unpickling, maintaining consistency across derived classes.
***
### FunctionDef __repr__(self)
**__repr__**: The function of __repr__ is to provide a string representation of the Scalar instance.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Scalar class.

**Code Description**: The `__repr__` method in the `Scalar` class generates a string that represents the current state or content of an instance. Specifically, it returns a string that includes information about whether the quantum state represented by the `Scalar` instance is mixed or not. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **super().__repr__()**: This calls the `__repr__` method from the superclass (likely the base class for all scalar values). The result of this call is a string representation of the object, which typically includes basic information such as its type and value.

2. **[:-1] + (...)**: 
   - The slice notation `[:-1]` removes the last character from the string obtained by calling `super().__repr__()`. This could be to avoid including an extra parenthesis or comma that might not be needed.
   - The additional part `(, is_mixed=True)' if self.is_mixed else ')'` appends specific information about whether the quantum state represented by this scalar is mixed. If `self.is_mixed` returns `True`, it adds `, is_mixed=True)` to the string; otherwise, it simply adds a closing parenthesis.

This method ensures that when an instance of `Scalar` is printed or converted to a string, the output includes relevant details about its state, particularly whether it represents a mixed quantum state. This information can be crucial for debugging and understanding the current state of the quantum system being represented.

**Note**: Ensure that the internal attribute `_is_mixed` is correctly set based on the state's properties or calculations performed within the `Box` class. The accuracy of this method depends on the correct setting of `_is_mixed`.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# If the scalar represents a mixed quantum state
print(scalar)  # Output: (0.5, is_mixed=True)

# If the scalar represents a pure quantum state
print(scalar)  # Output: (0.5)
```
***
### FunctionDef array(self)
**array**: The function of `array` is to convert the data stored within a Scalar object into a NumPy array.
**parameters**: 
· self: The Scalar object from which the data will be extracted.

**Code Description**: The `array` method within the `Scalar` class converts the internal data stored in the `Scalar` object into a NumPy array. This is achieved by using the context manager provided by the `backend()` function, which ensures that the appropriate backend (such as NumPy) is used for this operation.

The code uses a context manager (`with backend()`) to temporarily set the active backend to 'numpy'. Inside this context, it creates a NumPy array from the data stored in the `Scalar` object. The use of `backend()` ensures that any operations performed within its scope are conducted using the specified backend, which is essential for maintaining consistency and compatibility with other parts of the system.

**Note**: Ensure that the Scalar object has valid data before calling the `array` method to avoid errors. Also, be aware that this method relies on NumPy being installed in your environment, as it uses NumPy's array functionality internally.

**Output Example**: If a `Scalar` object contains the list `[1, 2, 3]`, then invoking its `array` method would return a NumPy array equivalent to `np.array([1, 2, 3])`.

### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to return the conjugate transpose of the scalar value.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Scalar class.

**Code Description**: The `dagger` method computes and returns the conjugate transpose (also known as the Hermitian adjoint) of the scalar value represented by an instance of the `Scalar` class. This operation is fundamental in quantum computing, where it often corresponds to taking the complex conjugate of each element in a matrix or vector and then transposing it.

In the context of this project, the `dagger` method plays a crucial role in operations involving quantum gates and their adjoints. For example, when applying a gate operation to its corresponding adjoint (or dagger), certain properties of the quantum system are preserved, such as unitarity, which ensures that the overall probability amplitudes remain consistent.

The method achieves this by calling `self.data.conjugate()`, which returns the complex conjugate of the scalar value stored in the `data` attribute. The result is then returned without any further modification or additional operations, ensuring that the operation remains efficient and straightforward.

Since the `dagger` method relies on the `is_mixed` property to determine how it should represent the scalar (as mentioned in its documentation), it indirectly interacts with this internal state information. However, for the specific purpose of computing the conjugate transpose, the `is_mixed` attribute is not directly involved; instead, it serves as a metadata check that might influence other representations or behaviors within the class.

**Note**: Ensure that the `data` attribute contains valid numerical data (usually complex numbers) before calling this method. Also, be aware that the `dagger` operation is symmetric in the sense that applying `dagger` twice to a scalar should return the original value.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming 's' is an instance of Scalar with data = 1 + 2j
print(s.dagger())  # Output: (1-2j)
```

### FunctionDef __init__(self, data)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a MixedScalar object with specific data.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: data - This is the initial data that will be used to create an instance of the MixedScalar class.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in the `MixedScalar` class serves as the constructor for creating instances of this class. It takes a single argument, `data`, which represents the initial state or value that needs to be associated with the new instance. The method then calls the superclass's (presumably another class from which MixedScalar inherits) `__init__` method using `super().__init__(data, is_mixed=True)`.

Here’s a detailed analysis of this code:
1. **Initialization Call**: The line `super().__init__(data, is_mixed=True)` ensures that the parent class's initialization process is followed. This could involve setting up attributes or performing necessary operations that are common to all instances derived from the parent class.
2. **Additional Attribute Setting**: By passing `is_mixed=True`, it indicates a specific attribute or state for this instance of MixedScalar, distinguishing it from other subclasses or types of scalar objects. The `is_mixed` parameter likely affects how the object behaves or is treated within the broader context of the quantum gates.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `data` provided during instantiation is appropriate and valid for creating a MixedScalar object.
- Understanding the implications of setting `is_mixed=True` is crucial as it might affect the behavior of operations performed on this instance.
***
## ClassDef Sqrt
**Sqrt**: The function of Sqrt is to represent a 0-qubit quantum gate that scales by a square root.
**attributes**:
· data: The scalar value used to scale the quantum state.

**Code Description**: 
The `Sqrt` class inherits from `Scalar`, which itself is defined in the same module. This inheritance allows `Sqrt` to leverage the functionalities provided by `Scalar`. Specifically, the `Sqrt` class represents a 0-qubit quantum gate that scales states by a square root of its input data.

1. **Initialization**: The constructor `__init__` initializes an instance of `Sqrt` with a given scalar value (`data`). It sets the drawing name to include this value in a formatted string, prefixed by "sqrt(" and suffixed by ")". Additionally, it ensures that the `is_dagger` attribute is set to `False` if not already defined. The `Scalar.__init__` method is called to initialize common properties like domain and codomain (both are 0-qubit), name, and whether the state is mixed.

2. **Serialization**: The `__setstate__` method handles deserialization by setting the `_z` attribute to `None`, ensuring that it aligns with the initialization logic of the base class.

3. **Array Representation**: The `array` property returns an array representation of the square root of the scalar data, using the current backend's NumPy instance.

4. **Adjoint Operation**: The `dagger` method simply returns another instance of `Sqrt`, indicating that the adjoint of a square root gate is itself (since \(\sqrt{a}^\dagger = \sqrt{a}\)).

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input to the `Sqrt` constructor is a valid scalar value, as this class does not perform any validation on its input. The `Scalar` class provides basic initialization and representation functionalities, while `Sqrt` extends these for quantum-specific operations.

**Output Example**: 
```python
from discopy.quantum.gates import Sqrt

# Create an instance of Sqrt with a scalar value
sqrt_gate = Sqrt(4)
print(sqrt_gate.array)  # Output: [2.]
```

In this example, the `Sqrt` gate is created with a scalar value of 4, resulting in a square root of 2 when represented as an array. This output can be used in further quantum operations or circuit constructions.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, data)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an instance of the Sqrt class.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: data (The input data that needs to be formatted)

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Sqrt` class by calling its superclass's `__init__` method with the provided `data` and setting a specific name for this instance. It then formats the `data` using the `format_number` function to generate a drawing name that includes the square root operation.

1. **Initialization**: The first line of the `__init__` method calls `super().__init__(data, name="sqrt")`. This is essential as it ensures that any initialization logic defined in the superclass (likely the `gates.py` module) is executed. By passing `name="sqrt"`, this sets a default name for the gate, which can be overridden if necessary.

2. **Formatting**: The second line of the method assigns a drawing name to the instance using `self.drawing_name = f"sqrt({format_number(data)})"`. This line ensures that when visualizing or representing the Sqrt gate in diagrams or text, it will display as "sqrt(<formatted-data>)". Here, `format_number` is responsible for converting the input data into a string representation. The use of an f-string allows for easy and dynamic construction of this name.

3. **Usage Context**: This method is part of a broader system where gates in quantum circuits are represented both programmatically and visually. By setting a meaningful drawing name, it aids in creating clear and understandable visualizations or textual representations of the circuit. The `format_number` function ensures that numerical data within the gate's representation is handled consistently and user-friendly.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `data` is compatible with string formatting to avoid errors during initialization. If `data` cannot be formatted, it will return the original value, maintaining consistency in how the Sqrt operation is represented.
***
### FunctionDef __setstate__(self, state)
**__setstate__**: The function of __setstate__ is to restore the state of an object from a serialized representation.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: state (dict) - A dictionary containing the serialized state of the Sqrt object.

**Code Description**:
The `__setstate__` method in the `Sqrt` class is responsible for restoring the internal state of the object after it has been deserialized. This method is typically used during the process of pickling and unpickling objects, where an object's state is saved to a file or other storage medium and later restored.

In this specific implementation:
1. The `super().__setstate__(state)` call ensures that any common state restoration logic defined in the parent class (if applicable) is also executed.
2. If the attribute `is_dagger` is not already set (indicated by `self.is_dagger is None`), it assigns a default value of `False` to this attribute.

This method helps maintain consistency and ensures that all necessary state information is properly restored, even if some attributes were not explicitly serialized or had their initial values changed after serialization. By setting the `is_dagger` attribute to `False`, the object can retain a known default behavior until its true state is fully restored from the provided `state` dictionary.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that all relevant attributes are properly handled within `__setstate__` to avoid any inconsistencies during deserialization. Additionally, if more complex state restoration logic is required, it should be integrated into this method or called as part of its implementation.
***
### FunctionDef array(self)
**array**: The function of `array` is to convert the square root of the data stored within an Sqrt object into a NumPy array.
**Parameters**:
· self: An instance of the Sqrt class.

**Code Description**: 
The `array` method in the `Sqrt` class is designed to transform the internal data (referred to as `self.data`) by taking its square root and then converting it into a NumPy array. This process involves using the context manager provided by the `backend()` function, which ensures that operations are performed with an appropriate matrix backend.

1. **Context Manager Usage**: The method uses the `with backend() as np:` statement to temporarily set the current backend to NumPy (`np`). This ensures that all subsequent operations within this block use NumPy for computations.
2. **Square Root Calculation**: The square root of `self.data` is calculated using the expression `self.data ** .5`. Here, `.5` represents the exponent used in calculating the square root.
3. **Array Conversion**: The result of the square root calculation is then converted to a NumPy array using `np.array()`, ensuring that the output is compatible with other operations within the NumPy ecosystem.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.data` contains numerical values, as it will be used in mathematical computations. Additionally, this method relies on having an appropriate backend set up by the `backend()` function to perform these operations correctly.

**Output Example**: Given a Sqrt object where `self.data = [4, 9, 16]`, the output of the `array` method would be:
```
[2. 3. 4.]
```
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to return the original gate itself.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method in the `Sqrt` class within the `gates.py` module returns the instance of the current object (`self`). In quantum computing, the dagger operation typically represents the adjoint or Hermitian conjugate of a gate. However, this implementation seems to be a simple identity function that does not perform any actual transformation but merely returns the original gate.

This method could serve as a placeholder or for specific contexts where a gate needs to refer back to itself without applying any changes. For instance, it might be used in certain operations where the adjoint of a gate is needed but can be simplified to the identity operation.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self` is properly defined and the class has been instantiated before calling this method.
- This method does not modify the state of the object; it simply returns the current instance, which could lead to confusion if used in contexts expecting a transformation.

**Output Example**: If an instance of the `Sqrt` gate is created as `sqrt_gate`, then `sqrt_gate.dagger()` will return `sqrt_gate`.
