## ClassDef Ob
**Ob**: The function of Ob is to represent a pivotal object that has coinciding left and right adjoints.
**Attributes**: 
· name: The name of the object.
· z (bool): Whether the object is an adjoint or not.

**Code Description**: 

The `Ob` class in `discopy/pivotal.py` is designed to model a pivotal object within the context of category theory. A pivotal object has the unique property that its left and right adjoints coincide, meaning they are essentially the same. This class extends functionality from another rigid object (presumably defined in the `rigid` module) by adding specific behavior related to being pivotal.

The constructor for this class takes two parameters:
- `name`: A string representing the name of the object.
- `z (bool)`: A boolean indicating whether the object is an adjoint or not. This attribute is used internally and determines the nature of the object's adjoints.

A key method in this class is a property named `l` and `r`, which are identical, returning another instance of `Ob`. The implementation uses a lambda function to create a new `Ob` instance with the same name but with the boolean value for `z` toggled. This effectively creates an adjoint object from the original one, demonstrating the pivotal property where left and right adjoints coincide.

This class is called by another class named `Ty`, which is also defined in the same file (`discopy/pivotal.py`). The `Ty` class uses `Ob` as its default factory for creating objects of type `Ob`. This relationship suggests that `Ty` can contain instances of `Ob`, thereby integrating pivotal objects into a broader category-theoretic structure.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the `name` parameter is meaningful and unique within the context where these objects are used. The `z` attribute should be set appropriately to reflect whether an object is considered an adjoint in your specific application.
## ClassDef Ty
**Ty**: The function of Ty is to represent a pivotal type within the context of category theory.

**Attributes**:
· inside: The objects inside the type.
· ob_factory: A reference to the Ob class used as the factory for creating objects of this class.

**Code Description**: 
The `Ty` class in the project represents a pivotal type, which is an extension of the concept from rigid categories where left and right adjoints coincide. This class inherits from or references classes that define the structure and behavior of types and arrows within a category. The primary role of `Ty` is to encapsulate the properties specific to pivotal types.

- **Parameter Analysis**: 
  - `inside`: This parameter represents the internal objects contained within the type, which are crucial for defining the operations and transformations in the context of category theory.
  
- **Class Inheritance and Relationships**:
  - The `Ty` class is likely related to other classes such as `Category`, `Diagram`, and `Functor`. For instance, it inherits or references these classes to define its behavior within a pivotal category framework. Specifically, it interacts with the `Category` class, which defines the structure of objects and arrows in a pivotal category.
  - The `ob_factory` attribute points to the `Ob` class, indicating that instances of `Ty` are created using this factory method. This is typical in object-oriented design where factories are used to manage the instantiation process.

- **Functional Perspective**:
  - In the context of category theory and its applications, such as in quantum computing or diagrammatic reasoning, pivotal types play a crucial role. The `Ty` class ensures that operations involving these types respect the properties of adjointness in a pivotal category.
  - It is likely used in creating diagrams (instances of `Diagram`) from objects defined by `Ty`, and these diagrams can then be manipulated using functors and other categorical constructs.

- **Reference to Callers and Callees**:
  - The `Ty` class is called or instantiated when defining types within a pivotal category. For example, it might be used in the construction of diagrams where objects are represented by `Ty` instances.
  - It interacts with methods like `trace_factory`, which utilize `Ty` to create traces (feedback loops) in categorical diagrams.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the internal objects (`inside`) adhere to the properties required for pivotal types. Additionally, when creating functors or other categorical constructs, properly handle instances of `Ty` to maintain consistency with the pivotal category framework.
## ClassDef PRO
**PRO**: The function of PRO is to represent a natural number `n` as a pivotal type of length `n`.

**Attributes**:
· n: The length of the PRO type.

**Code Description**: 
The `PRO` class is designed to encapsulate the concept of a natural number `n` within the framework of category theory, specifically in the context of pivotal categories. This class inherits from two other classes: `rigid.PRO` and `Ty`, indicating its role in both rigid and pivotal type systems.

- **Inheritance**: The inheritance from `rigid.PRO` suggests that `PRO` maintains properties related to adjointness, which are fundamental in rigid categories. However, the additional pivotal nature is introduced through the second parent class `Ty`. This dual inheritance ensures that `PRO` objects not only adhere to the structure of a rigid type but also respect the pivotal category axioms.

- **Property `l = r`**: The property definition for both left and right adjoints (`l` and `r`) being identical is significant. In a pivotal category, this equality means that every object has an adjoint that coincides with itself on both sides. This symmetry is crucial for operations involving `PRO` types, ensuring consistency in the categorical framework.

- **Parameter Analysis**: The single parameter `n` (an integer) represents the length or size of the PRO type. This parameter is essential as it defines the scope and behavior of the PRO object within a diagrammatic context. For instance, when constructing diagrams or performing operations that involve `PRO`, the value of `n` directly influences the structure and transformations.

- **Interaction with Ty**: The class `Ty` plays a critical role in defining pivotal types. `PRO` inherits from `Ty`, which means it can leverage the properties and methods defined in `Ty`. This inheritance ensures that `PRO` objects are well-formed within the pivotal category framework, maintaining consistency with other types and operations.

- **Usage Context**: The `PRO` class is likely used in scenarios where natural numbers need to be represented as pivotal types. For example, it might be employed in constructing diagrams or performing categorical transformations that involve specific lengths of PRO types. Its interaction with other classes such as `rigid.PRO` and `Ty` ensures that these operations are performed correctly within the category theory context.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the value of `n` is appropriate for the intended application in a pivotal category. Additionally, when constructing diagrams or performing categorical operations involving `PRO`, consider how the length `n` affects the overall structure and behavior of the diagram.

### FunctionDef trace_factory(cls, diagram, left)
**trace_factory**: The function of `trace_factory` is to create a trace of a given diagram by pre- or post-composing it with cups and caps to form a feedback loop.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: `diagram`: The input diagram to be traced, which must be an instance of the Diagram class.
· parameter2: `left`: A boolean indicating whether to trace on the left (`True`) or right (`False`).

**Code Description**: 
The function `trace_factory` takes a `Diagram` object and a Boolean flag `left`. It performs the following steps:

1. **Initialization of Traced Wire**: Depending on the value of `left`, it initializes `traced_wire` as either the first wire in the diagram's domain (`diagram.dom[:1]`) or the last wire in the diagram's domain (`diagram.dom[-1:]`).

2. **Domains and Codomains Adjustment**:
   - If tracing on the left, it adjusts the domains (`dom`) and codomains (`cod`) of both the input diagram and `traced_wire` by excluding the first element from each.
   - If tracing on the right, it adjusts them by excluding the last element from each.

3. **Composition with Cap Factory**:
   - It composes the adjusted domain with a cap factory object for the right trace or the traced wire for the left trace.
   - This step essentially connects the first (or last) wire of the diagram to a feedback loop via a cup and cap, forming a closed circuit.

4. **Application and Composition**:
   - The function then applies the adjusted domain to the input diagram using the `@` operator.
   - It further composes this result with another cap factory object for the right trace or the traced wire for the left trace.
   - This step ensures that the feedback loop is correctly formed, encapsulating the original diagram within a closed circuit.

5. **Final Composition**:
   - The function applies the adjusted codomain to the previous composition using the `@` operator and finally composes it with another cup factory object for the right trace or the traced wire for the left trace.
   - This ensures that the entire structure is correctly formed, maintaining the integrity of the feedback loop.

The final result is a new diagram representing the traced version of the input diagram, encapsulated within a feedback loop as specified by `left`.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `diagram` is an instance of the Diagram class and that the Boolean flag `left` is either `True` or `False`. The function assumes that the necessary factory methods (`cap_factory` and `cup_factory`) are available for creating the required cups and caps.

**Output Example**: 
If a diagram with two wires `A` and `B` is traced on the left, the output will be a new diagram where wire `A` is connected to a feedback loop involving another cup and cap, effectively tracing over it. The same process applies for right tracing but starting from the last wire.

### FunctionDef rotate(self, left)
**rotate**: The function of rotate is to return a new Box object with its domain and codomain rotated.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: left (bool) - If `left` is set to `True`, the rotation will be performed from the left side; otherwise, it defaults to rotating from the right side. However, in this implementation, the `left` parameter is not used.
**Code Description**: The function `rotate` modifies a Box object by changing its domain and codomain while keeping other properties such as name, data, is_dagger, and z unchanged. Specifically, if no rotation direction (`left`) is specified or if it defaults to `False`, the function rotates the Box so that the previous codomain becomes the new domain, and vice versa. This operation essentially flips the direction of the Box's input-output relationship.
- The method constructs a new instance of the same type as the original Box using `type(self)(...)`.
- It sets the name to remain unchanged (`self.name`).
- It updates the domain (`dom`) to be the current codomain (`self.cod.r`), and vice versa for the codomain (`cod`).
- The data, is_dagger status, and z value are preserved from the original Box instance.
**Note**: Although the `left` parameter is included in the function signature, it is not utilized within the body of the function. Therefore, its inclusion does not affect the behavior of the function.
**Output Example**: If you have a Box object named `box` with domain A and codomain B, calling `rotate(box)` will return a new Box instance with domain B and codomain A. If `left=True` is specified (though it has no effect in this implementation), it would still produce the same result as not specifying it at all.
***
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to return the daggered version of the current Box.
**parameters**: This Function takes no parameters.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method returns a new instance of the `Box` class with updated attributes. Specifically, it inverts the domain (`dom`) and codomain (`cod`) of the original box, effectively performing the dagger operation. The name remains unchanged, but the boolean flag `is_dagger` is toggled to indicate whether the box has undergone the dagger transformation. Additionally, the attribute `z`, which is likely a parameter used in constructing the Box, is retained as it is.

Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part does:
- **return type**: The method returns an instance of the `Box` class.
- **type(self)**: This creates a new instance of the same class (`Box`) that the current object belongs to.
- **name=self.name**: The name of the box remains unchanged in the new Box instance.
- **dom=self.cod, cod=self.dom**: The domain and codomain attributes are swapped. If the original box had `dom` as A and `cod` as B, the new box will have `dom` as B and `cod` as A.
- **data=self.data**: Any additional data associated with the Box instance is retained in the new instance.
- **is_dagger=not self.is_dagger**: The `is_dagger` attribute is toggled. If it was `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa, indicating whether the box has been daggered or not.
- **z=self.z**: The `z` attribute is retained as it is.

**Note**: 
1. This method assumes that the Box class has attributes named `name`, `dom`, `cod`, `data`, `is_dagger`, and `z`.
2. The `is_dagger` attribute should be properly defined to track whether a box has been daggered.
3. Ensure that any additional data (`data`) is appropriately handled, as it may contain references or state information.

**Output Example**: 
If the original Box instance had attributes like `name='A'`, `dom='X'`, `cod='Y'`, `is_dagger=False`, and `z=10`, then calling the `dagger` method would result in a new Box with:
- `name='A'`
- `dom='Y'`
- `cod='X'`
- `is_dagger=True`
- `z=10`
***
### FunctionDef is_conjugate(self)
**is_conjugate**: The function of is_conjugate is to determine whether the box is a conjugate.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self (The instance of Box class)

**Code Description**: 
The `is_conjugate` method checks if the current Box object is a conjugate. A conjugate in this context refers to the transpose of a dagger, which is an important concept in category theory and quantum computing. The method returns `True` if the box has both the `is_dagger` attribute set to `True` and a non-zero value for the `z` attribute, indicating that it meets the criteria for being a conjugate.

This function plays a crucial role in determining whether a Box object represents a specific type of morphism (a transposed dagger) within the category theory framework used by this project. The `is_conjugate` method is essential for operations that rely on identifying and manipulating these specific types of objects, ensuring correct behavior in various computations.

**Note**: Ensure that the `z` attribute is properly initialized before calling `is_conjugate`, as it plays a critical role in determining if the box is a conjugate. Additionally, any changes to the `is_dagger` attribute should be handled carefully to avoid unexpected results.

**Output Example**: The method will return `True` if both conditions are met (i.e., `self.is_dagger` is `True` and `bool(self.z)` evaluates to `True`). Otherwise, it returns `False`. For example:
```python
# Assuming a Box instance with is_dagger=True and z=1
print(box_instance.is_conjugate())  # Output: True

# Assuming a Box instance with is_dagger=False or z=None/0
print(box_instance.is_conjugate())  # Output: False
```
***
### FunctionDef to_drawing(self)
**to_drawing**: The function of `to_drawing` is to convert the Box object into a drawing representation while preserving its conjugate status.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: self - The instance of the Box class

**Code Description**: 
The `to_drawing` method is responsible for converting the current Box object into a visual representation, likely using a diagram or graphical format. It leverages the superclass's `to_drawing` method to generate the initial drawing and then updates this result by setting the `is_conjugate` attribute based on the current instance's properties.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:
1. **Superclass Call**: The method starts by calling `super().to_drawing()`, which is inherited from an upper-level class in the inheritance hierarchy. This call ensures that any common drawing logic defined in the superclass is applied to the Box object.
2. **Attribute Update**: After obtaining the initial drawing result, the method updates the `is_conjugate` attribute of this result with the current instance's `is_conjugate` value. This step is crucial for maintaining consistency between the internal state of the Box and its visual representation, ensuring that the drawing accurately reflects whether the box represents a conjugate.
3. **Return**: Finally, the method returns the updated drawing object.

This function plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the graphical representation of Box objects within the project, especially when dealing with complex diagrams involving conjugates. By updating the `is_conjugate` attribute, it ensures that the visual output correctly indicates whether the box is a conjugate, which is essential for understanding and interpreting the diagram.

**Note**: Ensure that the `is_conjugate` attribute is properly set before calling `to_drawing`, as this attribute significantly influences how the object is represented graphically. Additionally, any changes to the `is_conjugate` property should be handled carefully to avoid inconsistencies in the visual output.

**Output Example**: The method returns a drawing representation of the Box object with its `is_conjugate` status correctly applied. For example:
```python
# Assuming a Box instance that is a conjugate (is_dagger=True and z=1)
drawing = box_instance.to_drawing()
print(drawing.is_conjugate)  # Output: True

# Assuming a non-conjugate Box instance (is_dagger=False or z=None/0)
drawing = another_box_instance.to_drawing()
print(drawing.is_conjugate)  # Output: False
```

## ClassDef Cup
**Cup**: The function of Cup is to represent a pivotal cup in a diagrammatic categorical framework.
**Attributes**: 
· left (Ty): The atomic type on one side of the cup.
· right (Ty): The atomic type on the other side of the cup.

**Code Description**: The `Cup` class is designed to model an object in a pivotal category, which is a concept from category theory. A pivotal category extends the notion of a monoidal category by introducing duals and additional structure. In this context, a `Cup` represents one half of such a structure, specifically the "dual" or "adjoint" part.

The class is initialized with two atomic types (`left` and `right`), which define its domain and codomain in the categorical sense. The `rotate` method allows for a transformation that can be used to change the orientation of the cup, while the `dagger` method computes the adjoint (or dual) of the `Cup`, effectively creating a corresponding `Cap`.

The `to_drawing` property ensures that the `Cup` object is correctly represented in visual diagrams. This involves setting properties like `is_conjugate`, which indicates whether the cup should be depicted with certain characteristics, such as being conjugate (i.e., the transpose of a dagger).

**Note**: Ensure that the `rotate` and `dagger` methods are properly implemented to handle the transformation and adjoint operations correctly. The `cup_factory` method or property must also be defined and accessible to create instances of `Cup`.

**Output Example**: If an instance of `Cup` is created with `Ty('a')` as its left type and `Ty('b')` as its right type, calling the `dagger` method will return a corresponding `Cap` with `Ty('a')` on one side and `Ty('b')` on the other. For example:
```python
cup = Cup(Ty('a'), Ty('b'))
cap = cup.dagger()
```
Here, `cap` would be an instance of the `Cap` class with `Ty('a')` as its left type and `Ty('b')` as its right type.
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of `dagger` is to produce the dagger of a pivotal cup.
**parameters**:
· `self`: An instance of the Cup class.

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method within the `Cup` class returns an instance of the `Cap` class. This method takes into account the properties of the current `Cup` instance, specifically its `left` and `right` attributes, to construct a corresponding `Cap`. The construction process involves using these attributes as parameters for creating the `Cap`, ensuring that the relationship between the cup and cap is maintained according to the rules defined in the context of the project.

The method relies on another class or factory method called `cap_factory`, which is responsible for generating the `Cap` object based on the provided left and right inputs. This ensures a consistent and well-defined transformation from a `Cup` to its corresponding `Cap`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `cap_factory` method is correctly implemented to handle the creation of `Cap` objects.
- The `left` and `right` attributes should be properly initialized in the `Cup` instance before calling the `dagger` method.

**Output Example**: 
If a `Cup` instance with `left = 1` and `right = 2` is passed to the `dagger` method, it will return a `Cap` object constructed using these values. For example:
```python
cap_instance = cup_instance.dagger()
# cap_instance might be an instance of Cap with specific attributes based on the implementation details.
```
This output represents the transformation from a `Cup` to its corresponding `Cap`, adhering to the project's design principles and ensuring that the relationship between these two objects is preserved.
***
## ClassDef Cap
**Cap**: The function of Cap is to represent a rigid cap within a pivotal diagram.
**Attributes**:
· left (Ty): The atomic type.
· right (Ty): Its adjoint.

**Code Description**: 
The `Cap` class inherits from two base classes: `rigid.Cap` and `Box`. This design allows the `Cap` object to leverage functionalities from both its parent classes while maintaining a specific structure relevant to pivotal diagrams. 

- The `__init__` method initializes an instance of `Cap` with parameters `left` (the atomic type) and `right` (its adjoint). These parameters are essential for defining the type structure within categorical diagrams.
- The `dagger` method returns a `Cup` object, which is essentially the dagger or dual of the current `Cap`. This operation is fundamental in category theory, particularly when dealing with pivotal categories where each morphism has a well-defined dual.

The `__ambiguous_inheritance__` attribute indicates that there might be some ambiguity or conflict between methods inherited from both parent classes. However, this does not affect the basic functionality of creating and manipulating caps within categorical diagrams.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the types passed to `left` and `right` are compatible with the category theory framework being used.
- The `dagger` method is crucial for operations involving duals in pivotal categories; it should be called whenever a Cap needs to be transformed into its corresponding Cup.

**Output Example**: When creating an instance of `Cap` with specific types, the output would be another object representing the dagger (Cup).

```python
cap = Cap(left=Ty('a'), right=Ty('b'))
dagger_cap = cap.dagger()  # Returns a Cup object with left=Ty('b') and right=Ty('a')
```

This example demonstrates how to instantiate a `Cap` and obtain its dagger, which is essential for constructing diagrams in category theory.
### FunctionDef dagger(self)
**dagger**: The function of dagger is to compute the dagger (adjoint) of a Cap.
**parameters**: 
· self: An instance of the Cap class.

**Code Description**: 
The `dagger` method within the `Cap` class returns an instance of the `Cup` class. This method utilizes the `cup_factory` attribute, which is presumably a factory method or property that constructs and returns a `Cup` object based on the left and right types of the current Cap instance.

This method essentially computes the adjoint (dagger) of the Cap by creating a corresponding Cup with the same atomic types but in reverse order. The relationship between this function and its callees is that it relies on the `cup_factory` to create the necessary object, which further underscores the pivotal nature of these categorical objects.

**Note**: Ensure that the `cup_factory` method or property is correctly defined and accessible within the Cap class for this operation to succeed. Also, be mindful that the types `left` and `right` must be properly defined and compatible with the factory method's expectations.

**Output Example**: If a Cap instance has left type `Ty1` and right type `Ty2`, calling `dagger()` will return a Cup with left type `Ty1` and right type `Ty2`. For example, if `cap = Cap(Ty('a'), Ty('b'))`, then `cap.dagger()` would return a `Cup(Ty('a'), Ty('b'))`.
